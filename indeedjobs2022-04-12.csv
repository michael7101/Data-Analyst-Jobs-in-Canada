A little bit about Habanero
Habanero is a Canadian consulting company with offices in Calgary, Toronto, Vancouver and Winnipeg. We are passionate about helping people and organizations thrive. We believe that every organization can be exceptional, and we help to humanize the world of work through the creation of modern workplaces and the cultural, communication, collaboration and content experiences that power them. Our solutions are globally recognized, and we have consecutively ranked as one of Canada's top ten best places to work for the last 11 years. Habanero is proud to be ranked #9 on the Great Place to Work® Canada List of Best Workplaces™ for 2021.

The best kind of work
Habanero is an organization where people who are creative, hard-working, friendly, honest and open come together to do great work. We have a shared passion for solving complex issues that will benefit other people and organizations. We only hire people we can count on, so you can be certain that you are joining a team of happy and competent team members. We service our clients and projects across Canadian time zones and consultants are resourced on cross-regional teams.

Supporting each other in personal growth
We are a lattice organization, meaning that there is no traditional hierarchy. There is no typical boss, and you don’t report to a manager. Instead, we have a more holistic approach to mentorship – we offer employee journey coaches who are there to help you with all things career and life. We believe it’s up to you to make the most out of your career, and we are here to support and encourage you every step of the way.

A diverse culture of clever humans

We also enjoy smaller perks like free snacks and drinks and group lunches where you can reconnect with your team after a long week. There are training and development opportunities for those who wish to continue evolving their skills. All employees start at three weeks of vacation.

Bringing life to work
Everyone at Habanero probably has their own story around this, but it's probably safe to say that it starts with people feeling like they can bring their whole selves to work. The cornerstone idea is that we want to support people having great lives, not just great work lives (we can't say our relationship begins at 9:00 and ends at 5:00). Other things we've heard make the difference for Habs:
People starting their careers get to jump in and gain experience right away
Employee journey support system (career coach)
The culture of trust, transparency, inclusivity, collaboration, autonomy... to name a few
The awesome people that work here (of course)
Flexible work schedule
Training and development opportunities when we can support them
We recently asked Habs to share what they feel makes us one of the Best Places to Work in Canada and the loudest response was 'our people' (with 'our teams' and 'balance' not far behind). So, if this sounds like something you want to be a part of, and you have the skills and experience to contribute, then we want to meet you!",NA,Full-time,Remote,6 reviews,4.5

Since we first opened our doors in 2009, the world of commerce has evolved immensely – and so has Square. After enabling anyone to take a payment and never miss a sale, we saw sellers stymied by disparate, outmoded products and tools that wouldn’t work together. So we expanded into software and started building integrated, omnichannel solutions – to help sellers sell online, manage inventory, run a busy kitchen, book appointments, engage loyal buyers, and hire and pay staff. And across it all, we’ve embedded financial services tools at the point of sale, so merchants can access a business loan and manage their cash flow all in one place.

Today, we’re a partner to sellers of all sizes – large, enterprise-scale businesses with complex commerce operations, sellers just starting out, as well as merchants who began selling with Square and have grown larger over time. As our sellers scale, so do our solutions. We all grow together.


There is a massive opportunity in front of us. We’re building a business that is big, meaningful, and lasting. And we are helping sellers around the world do the same.

One of the programs driving the need for formal decommissioning practice is the Replace Business Systems (RBS).
The RBS program is replacing old ERP systems currently used at each mine site across four steams of value chains:
Health, Safety, Environment, and Community
Finance (Source to Pay)
Maintenance and Asset Management
Human Resource and Information Management
Sourcing and Contracting
Several existing sites were or are still being supported by withholding ‘mainframe’ type technology (AS/400, various versions and deployments of JD Edwards, and custom-developed payroll solutions) that also need to be taken through a Decommissioning practice or framework.
The scope of the decommissioning strategy must address all future Teck applications at end of life or being replaced by a new/different application. Ideally, a repeatable process will be crafted to manage and affect the decommissioning of all applications being retired. This will include custom-built applications, COTS and On-prem solutions, and all Cloud (SaaS) applications since the historical data from all of these applications may need to be accessed.
Decommissioning includes all layers of the delivery stack:
Application code (source and prod),
In alignment with replacement project data conversion, data archiving, and ongoing data provisioning to future business processes,
APIs and Interface and integration components,
Associated scripts,
Infrastructure hardware (i.e. servers), storage devices, network devices,
All environments (dev, test, system test, user test, staging),
Any other utilities used to manage, coordinate or use the system,
Termination of all related contracts and costs.
Data or transactions that need to be referred back to or referenced.
Data that is required on a rolling basis for a defined period to compare new vs old i.e. budgets when comparing this vs last year or this year vs two years ago.
Data that is required to be aggregated with new data to provide trends or a current analysis based on x years prior. i.e. maintenance records and asset usage data (cycles, rotations, km’s, etc) to optimize maintenance schedules.
Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Business Information systems may require access to historical data from time to time, to adequately meet a requirement or evolve future strategies.
Another major program at Teck includes the RACE transformation program. RACE is Teck’s business transformation strategy. It began with the implementation of our first strategy - RACE21. This focused on taking a company-wide approach to renewing our technology infrastructure, accelerating, and scaling our automation and robotics program, connecting our data systems to enable the broad application of advanced analytics and artificial intelligence, and empowering our employees. The success of RACE21 has been critical to our success as a business. Our ongoing transformation strategies include RACE25 where we will continue to drive a step-change in Teck's performance, and help Teck become the most innovative and sustainable miner in the world.
Collaborating with the Manager of Enterprise Applications Management acting as Decommissioning Program Lead, the Project Manager/Senior Business Analyst (herein referred to as “Snr PM/BA Decomm”) will assist in developing an overall Decommissioning Practice at Teck.
