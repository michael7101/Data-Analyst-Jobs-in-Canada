 Starburst is the fastest, most efficient analytics engine for a data warehouse, data lake, or data mesh. Our software provides fast and easy access to data, no matter where it lives, with a best-in-class MPP SQL engine that shortens the path to value for data. The Starburst Enterprise Platform leverages the power of the open source Trino (formerly PrestoSQL) to query data across any database, making it instantly actionable for data-driven organizations. Our SaaS offering, Starburst Galaxy provides all the benefits of Trino and Starburst in an easy to use, fully-managed enterprise-ready multi-cloud SaaS platform designed by Trino’s original creators and experts.
  


 With Starburst, teams can lower the total cost of their infrastructure and analytics investments, prevent vendor lock-in, and use the existing tools that work for their business. Though Starburst has achieved a unicorn status and raised $414M in venture funding from top investors, we were founded with customers and revenue from the very beginning. Our customers love us, we operate globally, and we are proud to be named a Best Place to Work. Come join our team of All-Stars!
  


 About the role



 To complement Starburst’s ability to access data anywhere, our goal is to make it easy for any business intelligence tool to connect to Starburst. Our vision is that any business analyst should be able to access any data source through the tool of their choice. We are looking for a BI Tools Integrations Engineer to help us make that a reality.
  


 Note that this is a role focused on integrating BI tools with our software so that our customers can build dashboards easily with Starburst driving data access. Rather than a role where you’ll be building dashboards or actively doing analytics using BI tools, this role requires you to get into the “guts” of the BI tools and how they play with Starburst.
  



Responsibilities:


 Design: Research and design integrations with business intelligence software
 Develop: Build custom connectors for business intelligence tools like Power BI and Tableau
 Test: Implement test automation, design and write tests
 Collaborate: Collaborate with teams globally across multiple time zones and operate in an Agile development environment






Some things we will look for:


 At least 3 years of experience
 Familiarity with BI tools such as Tableau, PowerBI, Looker, etc.
 Experience with JDBC and ODBC integrations
 An understanding of authentication mechanisms like LDAP, Kerberos, OAuth2.0
 Experience with Java or Python
 Comfortable with SQL and scripting languages
 Experience working with Microsoft technologies






Bonus points:


 Familiarity with Trino
 Windows development experience, particularly with ODBC






Benefits



 At Starburst, we’re constantly striving towards building a place where people come first by creating an environment of transparency, honesty, and respect. We take care of our global workforce by making sure employees enjoy competitive salaries and attractive stock grants, remote-friendly work options, access to quality and affordable insurance, and flexible and generous paid time off to start a family, travel, or just relax!
  


 Headquartered in Boston MA with offices in Warsaw and London and employees across Europe and the Americas, we are committed to hiring where the talent is.

As a team, we are working to set new standards on how to build and run solar energy sites at peak efficiency. As we continue to scale in 2022, we’re looking for more entry-level 
  Data Analyst & Report Specialist’s to join our diverse remote-first team. This is a unique opportunity to start your career as an Analyst in the renewable energy industry.
 


 What We're Building:



 Roughly 70% of global power still comes from non-renewable polluting energy sources. As a climate-friendly and cost-effective energy solution, solar has the potential to drastically reduce our global CO2 emissions, helping to meet the World’s climate obligations for a clean energy transition. However, getting sites up and running is only the beginning. Once solar projects are built, many factors can interfere with performance. What we know from a recent industry report is that solar projects are underperforming by up to 6.3% on average. This number may seem inconsequential, but if these facilities continually perform shy of targets, this could interfere with private investment causing a ripple effect. Aligning financial risk and reward with low-carbon energy investments is critical for shifting the economy in the direction of reduced emissions. Without substantial private sector investment in clean energy, it will be more difficult, more costly, and more time-consuming to address climate change on a global scale.
 


 At Heliolytics, we’re working with our client partners to close that performance gap in order to enable a sustainable transition to clean energy and secure the future of our industry. We’re building a suite of industry-leading tools and services to enable our clients, which include some of the largest solar energy producers in the world, to maximize their energy output each year. Every marginal increase in efficiency is a huge win for our team, our client partners, and the environment. To date, our optimizations have resulted in increased energy production equivalent to 130,500 car-years of CO2 reductions.
 


 Our Analysis & Reporting Team:



 We manage our entire workflow in-house, from gathering imagery data using industry-leading tools and techniques to providing clear, actionable insights for clients to make the best decisions for their renewable energy assets. Our Analysis & Reporting Team plays an instrumental role in ensuring that the collected solar field data is processed correctly, and turned into clear, consistent deliverables for our clients.
 
 As an Analyst, You Will:

 Onboard client assets into our internal systems
 Analyze collected field imagery and resulting anomaly distribution, suggest potential issues and remediation for client assets
 Identify trends across client portfolios and ensure that these are communicated through our reports
 Review data with our technical experts and write client reports
 Create other client deliverables using specialized software tools
 Complete tasks related to our analysis workflow, such as database management, troubleshooting and consulting projects

 Additionally, you’ll gain insight into:

 The North American and global renewable energy industries
 Solar (PV) system components, layouts, and maintenance
 Processing and presenting spatial datasets

 What You Bring:

 An interest in aerial imagery interpretation
 A keen eye for detail and a commitment to high quality standards
 Experience working on analysis-related projects (Internship & Academic experience considered)
 Experience working on projects with tight timelines, multiple stakeholders, or other complexities (Internship & Academic experience considered)
 Demonstrated ability to learn and adapt to new software technologies, and experience with broadly-used software packages (Adobe suite, Excel, Google suite, etc)
 A resourceful approach to problem solving 
A collaborative approach to communication and a genuine interest in the success and growth of the people you work with
 A passion for sustainability and an interest in renewable energy

 Bonus Points: 

Imagery interpretation experience (satellite-based imagery analysis, or aerial photo interpretation)
 GIS software or packages or geospatial analysis (note: this is not a GIS technician position)
 Some experience with Python or programming languages (Analysts regularly interact with our Development team)
 Experience with scientific classification schemes


 Working at Heliolytics



 Heliolytics is a mosaic of talented people with different interests and goals united by our mission to build a sustainable transition to clean energy. As a remote-first organization, we work hard to optimize all of our systems and processes to operate remotely whenever possible, however, we do like to meet in person on occasion.
 

   We value employee life outside of work and provide many ways to accommodate and support our staff in achieving their goals. You'll find a few ways we enact this below:
 


 Remote-First Environment
 

   Extended Health Benefits
 

   Health Spending Account
 

   Paid Vacation Policy
 

   Team Socials
 

   Education Budget
 


 Experience comes in many forms, many skills are transferable, and passion goes a long way. If the job description gets you pumped but your background isn’t exactly what we’ve described above, or if you strongly believe you bring qualifications beyond what we’ve outlined that would help you excel in this position, please consider applying.

  This role would oversee Evaluation Kit and the administration and analysis course surveys. They would be responsible for survey analysis, summary, and dissemination to administration and staff involved in supporting course and program design, which currently is a gap in our processes. The analysis and summary of the course evaluation data will support the college in the following ways: (1) a learning analyst would be able to link quantitative analysis with pedagogy, resulting in more targeted and evidence-based action on curriculum design and student experience; (2) evidence-based understanding of the student experience in individual courses can be shared with faculty, associate deans, and support staff so any issues can be addressed and effective course design practice can be celebrated and encouraged; (3) addressing targeted course design issues supports learner retention (5500 FLEs by 2025) and program/college reputation; (4) faculty requiring extra support to make course updates are identified by associate deans and support/resources prioritized by CTLI; (5) supporting the academic portfolio vitality assessment process, specifically in understanding the quality of curriculum and student experience in each program and across the institution. Furthermore, Evaluation Kit is being underutilized.

More about Hopper 




  Despite the pandemic’s impact on the travel industry, Hopper has emerged stronger than ever. As the travel industry continues to rebound, Hopper has demonstrated significant outperformance with its category-leading mobile-only marketplace, delivering value to customers and supply partners with the company’s proprietary suite of fintech offerings .
  




  Here are just a few stats that demonstrate the company’s recent growth:
  




Hopper’s valuation is now over $5B, which is more than triple our valuation from early 2020. 




The company grew its revenue by more than 300% YoY in 2021. Hopper’s monthly revenues are now 375% higher than its pre-pandemic high point and Hopper Cloud, Hopper’s new B2B initiative, is already 15% of its revenues and growing. 




According to Apptopia, Hopper was the #1 most downloaded OTA in the US in 2021. The app has over 70 million downloads. 




Hopper’s recovery is faster than the market and its share of the air travel market in North America is now 300% higher than prior to the pandemic, according to MIDT. We are now the 3rd largest air travel agency in North America. 




The company sells over $2B in travel and travel related financial services annually. 




Hopper’s fintech offerings, such as Price Freeze and Rebooking Guarantee, now represent over 70% of its air revenue. 




Given the success of its travel fintech, Hopper recently launched a B2B initiative called Hopper Cloud, where any travel provider can unlock a totally unique revenue stream by seamlessly integrating and offering Hopper’s travel content and fintech products. Hopper Cloud partners include Capital One, Kayak, Marriott, Amadeus, Trip.com , and MakeMyTrip. 




  The industry opportunity for Hopper Cloud is enormous as projections estimate that if all travel distribution channels offered travel fintech, it could increase the total consumer spend for the sector by $200 billion annually.
  




  And all this recent growth is just the beginning. There are still so many new opportunities we’re excited to tackle in the next year!",,Full-time,Remote,6 reviews,3.8,True,False,True,False,False,False,False

EA delivers games, content and online services for Internet-connected consoles, personal computers, mobile phones and tablets.
XDI's purpose is to accelerate development by identifying the world's best external partners, ensuring successful engagements, and sharing industry knowledge.
As part of EA Create, we search the globe for trusted and talented external partners to work with EA Studio game teams and central technology teams. We are a central team that owns EA’s due diligence evaluation process and risk management process. We support multiple disciplines, including co-dev, porting, art, animation, cinematics, UX-UI, engineering, and audio.
Key Responsibilities:

Partner evaluations and due diligence reporting using XDI’s risk management framework.
Supporting strategic partner portfolio management including regular check-ins and on-site assessments with established partners to ensure ongoing trust and viability.
As a key partner in EA’s Game Development Framework we support a portfolio of internal game teams and central tech teams by consulting on external development strategy, recommending partners, providing partner risk assessments, and occasionally helping with issue resolution.
Collaboration with a broad cross section of central teams including Legal, Security, Audit, Global Strategic Sourcing, Finance, Compliance, and other central roles to ensure clear process and program management of EA’s requirements for working with external partners.

Team Related:

The XDI team works in a mostly distributed fashion. We have members in Redwood Shores (California), Stockholm (Sweden), Vancouver (British Columbia), Orlando (Florida) and Shanghai (China)
We interface with team members and partners around the globe. Our work is primarily conducted using Zoom, email, Slack, and project management tools.
Early morning or evening calls and travel (when possible) are a reality for this role as we interface with global partners and teams. That said, our team is encouraged to strive for work life balance and to proactively manage capacity in a way that supports this goal.
Candidates with a strong preference for an in-person team dynamic may not thrive in this role as much communication and collaboration is now done remotely.
Our team members know that our team doesn’t start and stop with XDI. It’s important to expand our network (both within EA and externally).
Our team members are self-directed with an ability to quickly surface the right information at the right time to those who need it.

Business Partnerships:

XDI manages EA’s Strategic Partner portfolio. As an associate, you will be a supporting point of contact for a subset of this portfolio. You will assist in evaluating development and operational risks, issue resolution, and have a high degree of integrity when it comes to conducting oneself with outside key partners.
You will share critical knowledge about our partners with XDI, other Business Development groups, and teams across the company to ensure those working with our partners access the information they need to make key decisions.

Experience & Capabilities:

Our team strikes a fine balance between advocacy for our partners, both internal and external, and conducting risk evaluations to ensure EA’s IP is protected. Candidates have to be able to do both.
Ability to think and act globally. We interact with EA teams and external partners from all over the globe. We expect our team members to conduct themselves with high integrity and embrace cultural differences, value diverse opinions, and do their part to promote an inclusive development environment.
Demonstrated business acumen: this role requires objective decision making, and excellent collaboration ability with diverse teams and partners.
Lifelong learner who is inquisitive and enjoys knowledge acquisition as much as knowledge sharing. Should have a degree of comfort with public speaking, delivering presentations/panels, and facilitating brainstorming sessions.
Game development experience is highly desirable.
Experience in centralized departments such as studio operations, publishing, licensing, program management, business development are highly transferable for this role.
You will be expected to travel on-site to visit your partners on occasion and while often you will travel with other XDI team members or EA game team members there are times you will be asked to travel alone. Must have a degree of comfort with business travel and everything that comes with it (expense reports, airports, time zone changes, etc). On average, XDI team members do one international trip (1 week+/- duration) and 2-3 short domestic trips a quarter.

XDI Team Values:

Collaborative team players.
Ethical, fair, objective decision makers.
Support and solution focused.
Think and act globally.
Work life balance is key to our success.
Self-directed with inner drive.
When the going gets tough, the tough get going!
Influence without ego.
Passion and enthusiasm.
