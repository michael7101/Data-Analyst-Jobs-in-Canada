Data Analyst & Report Specialist (Remote),Heliolytics,"Toronto, ON",2022-06-25,"Over the last two years, we’ve seen a massive increase in global demand for our services. As a team, we are working to set new standards on how to build and run solar energy sites at peak efficiency. As we continue to scale in 2022, we’re looking for more entry-level 
  Data Analyst & Report Specialist’s to join our diverse remote-first team. This is a unique opportunity to start your career as an Analyst in the renewable energy industry.
 


 What We're Building:



 Roughly 70% of global power still comes from non-renewable polluting energy sources. As a climate-friendly and cost-effective energy solution, solar has the potential to drastically reduce our global CO2 emissions, helping to meet the World’s climate obligations for a clean energy transition. However, getting sites up and running is only the beginning. Once solar projects are built, many factors can interfere with performance. What we know from a recent industry report is that solar projects are underperforming by up to 6.3% on average. This number may seem inconsequential, but if these facilities continually perform shy of targets, this could interfere with private investment causing a ripple effect. Aligning financial risk and reward with low-carbon energy investments is critical for shifting the economy in the direction of reduced emissions. Without substantial private sector investment in clean energy, it will be more difficult, more costly, and more time-consuming to address climate change on a global scale.
 


 At Heliolytics, we’re working with our client partners to close that performance gap in order to enable a sustainable transition to clean energy and secure the future of our industry. We’re building a suite of industry-leading tools and services to enable our clients, which include some of the largest solar energy producers in the world, to maximize their energy output each year. Every marginal increase in efficiency is a huge win for our team, our client partners, and the environment. To date, our optimizations have resulted in increased energy production equivalent to 130,500 car-years of CO2 reductions.
 


 Our Analysis & Reporting Team:



 We manage our entire workflow in-house, from gathering imagery data using industry-leading tools and techniques to providing clear, actionable insights for clients to make the best decisions for their renewable energy assets. Our Analysis & Reporting Team plays an instrumental role in ensuring that the collected solar field data is processed correctly, and turned into clear, consistent deliverables for our clients.
 
 As an Analyst, You Will:

 Onboard client assets into our internal systems
 Analyze collected field imagery and resulting anomaly distribution, suggest potential issues and remediation for client assets
 Identify trends across client portfolios and ensure that these are communicated through our reports

More about Hopper 




  Despite the pandemic’s impact on the travel industry, Hopper has emerged stronger than ever. As the travel industry continues to rebound, Hopper has demonstrated significant outperformance with its category-leading mobile-only marketplace, delivering value to customers and supply partners with the company’s proprietary suite of fintech offerings .
  




  Here are just a few stats that demonstrate the company’s recent growth:
  




Hopper’s valuation is now over $5B, which is more than triple our valuation from early 2020. 




The company grew its revenue by more than 300% YoY in 2021. Hopper’s monthly revenues are now 375% higher than its pre-pandemic high point and Hopper Cloud, Hopper’s new B2B initiative, is already 15% of its revenues and growing. 




According to Apptopia, Hopper was the #1 most downloaded OTA in the US in 2021. The app has over 70 million downloads. 




Hopper’s recovery is faster than the market and its share of the air travel market in North America is now 300% higher than prior to the pandemic, according to MIDT. We are now the 3rd largest air travel agency in North America. 




The company sells over $2B in travel and travel related financial services annually. 




Hopper’s fintech offerings, such as Price Freeze and Rebooking Guarantee, now represent over 70% of its air revenue. 




Given the success of its travel fintech, Hopper recently launched a B2B initiative called Hopper Cloud, where any travel provider can unlock a totally unique revenue stream by seamlessly integrating and offering Hopper’s travel content and fintech products. Hopper Cloud partners include Capital One, Kayak, Marriott, Amadeus, Trip.com , and MakeMyTrip. 




  The industry opportunity for Hopper Cloud is enormous as projections estimate that if all travel distribution channels offered travel fintech, it could increase the total consumer spend for the sector by $200 billion annually.
  




  And all this recent growth is just the beginning. There are still so many new opportunities we’re excited to tackle in the next year!",Full-time,Remote,True,python,,tableau,,bigquery,,,,sql,,,,ON

*Sheertex *fabrique les collants les plus résistants au monde. Ne vous contentez pas de nous croire sur parole : en 2018, nous avons été désignés comme l'une des « meilleures inventions » du magazine TIME! Nous sommes une entreprise qui s'enorgueillit d'utiliser la technologie pour faire progresser une industrie autrefois stagnante. Depuis nos débuts en créant une fibre que l'industrie de la bonneterie n'avait jamais utilisée jusqu'à nos efforts continus pour automatiser nos processus de fabrication ; le parcours de Sheertex a pour fil conducteur la volonté d'être innovant dans notre utilisation de la technologie. Même notre méthode de vente directe au consommateur par le biais de nos canaux en ligne n'était pas courante dans l'industrie de la bonneterie et c'est une autre façon pour Sheertex de faire les choses un peu différemment.
*Ce à quoi vous pouvez vous attendre au cours des 1 – 3 premiers mois : *à mesure que vous vous familiariserez avec l'entreprise, vous travaillerez avec l'équipe chargée des données pour aider les équipes chargées du marketing et des recettes à analyser les données brutes, à élaborer des rapports et à fournir des informations fondées sur les données.
*Ce à quoi vous pouvez vous attendre au cours des 3 – 6 premiers mois : *vous commencerez à vous approprier les données relatives au marketing et aux revenus, en acquérant une compréhension approfondie des données disponibles et de la manière dont elles peuvent être utilisées pour optimiser la prise de décision. Vous commencerez à détecter les erreurs, à remarquer les incohérences et à étudier les anomalies. Vous élargirez votre connaissance des données Sheertex, en commençant à étudier les données des opérations et à mieux comprendre les données internes associées à notre usine.

*Sheertex *makes the strongest pantyhose in the world. Don't just take our word for it—in 2018 we were named one of TIME's ""Best Inventions""! We are a company that prides itself on using technology to advance a once stagnant industry. Through our initial start of creating a fiber that the hosiery industry had never used before to our ongoing push to automate our manufacturing processes; the journey of Sheertex has a common thread of striving to be innovative in our use of technology. Even our method of selling direct-to-consumer through our online channels was uncommon in the hosiery industry, and is just another way Sheertex does things a little differently.
*What you can expect in the first 1-3 months: *as you familiarize yourself with the company, you will work with the Data team to assist the marketing and revenue teams in analyzing raw data, building reports, and providing data-driven insights.
*What you can expect in the first 3-6 months: *you will start to take ownership of the marketing and revenue data, gaining an in-depth understanding of what data are available, and how those can be used to optimize decision making. You will start to catch errors, notice inconsistencies, and investigate anomalies. You will broaden your knowledge of Sheertex data, by beginning to investigate data from Operations and get a better understanding of the internal data associated with our factory.Responsabilités/ Responsibilities:

Senior Data Analyst,Jane.app,,2022-07-18,"Jane is looking for an experienced Senior Data Analyst who will be responsible for delivering consistent, meaningful insights across the team. You will have strong experience with Looker and preferably experience in a fast-growing software company. You are excited about the opportunity to be responsible for analytics across multiple subject areas and looking forward to the prospect of mentoring junior analysts.
   




   Our small, collaborative team is responsible for delivering actionable insights across the entirety of Jane, so you are interested in championing a data informed culture across all areas of the business, from marketing to product and everything in between. You are passionate about transparency, accuracy, creating delightful experiences with data, and digging deep in to the ""why."" 
   We want every team at Jane to have the ability to make decisions inspired by data and you will have the opportunity to help make this happen from the ground up.
   




   Like with all positions at Jane, this position is a remote position, allowing you to work anywhere you want across Canada. Building a delighted team who can delight our customers is part of Jane’s DNA, so even though we’re not a strict 9 to 5 environment, we’re working hard to ensure that you also have a life outside of work. We pride ourselves on flexibility & autonomy, and when it comes to decision making, we take a decentralized approach ensuring that our teams' voices aren't just heard, but are acted upon. We're building something special at Jane, and we back that up with an employee stock option plan that ensures that everyone has a chance to share in Jane’s success.
  


 We really want the people who work at Jane to love being here, so it's important that we start off with a bit about what makes our company unique. Here are some specifics about what Jane is all about, and with these, hopefully, you have a better idea if this might be the kind of company you want to be part of.
  


 We’re a North Vancouver-born SaaS company with a distributed remote team across Canada, and our platform is modernizing the world of practice management software. We enable the likes of physiotherapists, mental health counsellors, chiropractors, and other allied health practitioners to run their practices in a digital-first way through features such as online booking, charting, scheduling, secure video, and billing along with an evolving library of features.
  


 Tens of thousands of healthcare practices globally are now running on Jane. In 2021, we processed over 73 million patient appointments, and our scheduling application alone handles more than 10 million API calls per day. Jane is now the number one choice for Allied Healthcare practitioners in Canada. We’re growing quicker in the US than we were here in Canada 3 years ago, and we’re now helping run clinics in 44 countries.
  


 We’re profitable, product-led, and growing organically to the point where 85% of our customer growth is either from customer referrals or word of mouth. Growth like this is unique, especially in the world of SaaS, and it doesn’t happen by chance. We have a brilliant team of over 250 employees who all do an amazing job of listening to our customers, building what they need, and providing industry-leading support.
  


 Last year alone we’ve grown our development team from 36 to 70, and the product team has doubled as a whole. 2022 is going to be a big year for Jane as we’re investing heavily into patient experience with our first patient-facing mobile app, enhancing our telehealth experience, building our own (J)analytics platform, working on global insurance integrations, and introducing new features like HIPAA compliant chat.
  


 Of course, it's not all about the numbers, but this puts into perspective the scale of Jane, from the thousands of practitioners whose lives are made easier each day to the millions of patients receiving treatment. If you’re the type of person excited by this growth, we’d love to speak with you.

Mastercard Foundation seeks a world where everyone has the opportunity to learn and prosper. Through its Young Africa Works strategy and Canadian EleV program, the Foundation works with partners to ensure that millions of young people, especially young women, access quality education, financial services, and dignified work. Mastercard Foundation was established in 2006 through the generosity of Mastercard when it became a public company. The Foundation is independent with its own Board of Directors and CEO.
 THE WORK AT THE FOUNDATION 
The Foundation has begun working within Canada in partnership with Indigenous communities and post-secondary institutions to listen, learn, and best understand how we can act in meaningful ways. The EleV strategy was co-created with Indigenous communities, young people, and partners to enable 30,000 Indigenous youth to complete their education and transition to dignified work aligned with their values and aspirations.
 As reflected in Canada's Truth and Reconciliation Commission Calls to Action, education is a key driver of improved socio-economic well-being. Through building partnerships with Indigenous communities, we look to expand our initiative ultimately helping to support a generation of transformative Indigenous young leaders who will be change agents within their communities. We believe that by setting a bold target, we will encourage engagement across sectors and create momentum that will elevate the strengths and opportunities of Indigenous youth. In keeping with our approach, Indigenous communities and young people will be the drivers of this transformation. The program will promote innovations to address longer-term systemic change to achieve economic prosperity and social well-being within Indigenous communities.
 The EleV team oversees current and emerging partnerships related to Indigenous education. Consistent with our overall vision and Youth Africa Works strategy, we will share learnings and opportunities to connect across the work of the Foundation. While operating in distinct contexts, the centrality of youth voice and vision, affirmation of culture and identity, and priority to enhance community capacity for self-determination are common threads upon which our work is strengthened and reinforced.
 UNDERSTANDING AFRICA PROGRAMS AT THE FOUNDATION
 We have entered a very exciting time at the Foundation as we scale up our operations across Africa to realize our Young Africa Works strategy. Our role at the Mastercard Foundation is to be a catalyst. Our Young Africa Works strategy focuses on working with others to spur systemic change so young people have the opportunity to find work that is dignified and fulfilling.
 The Foundation has opened offices in Rwanda, Kenya, Ghana, Senegal, Ethiopia, Nigeria, and Uganda, building a broader leadership presence in Africa to develop specific strategies that support youth employment. Within a country, we work with governments, the private sector, educators, young people, and other funders to improve the quality of education and vocational training, prepare young people for the work force, expand access to financial services for entrepreneurs and small businesses, and connect job seekers to dignified and fulfilling work.
 We are ambitious and driven. Our values transcend and rise above everything else as our guide. We encourage you to bring your bold ideas, curiosity, and expertise to your work. We laugh at ourselves and with each other. We are a team. Our journey together makes our impact even more meaningful.

This role will support the development of the Canada Asia Sustainability Tracker (CAST). CAST is an online, interactive platform for mapping and visualizing developments in the Asia Pacific with respect to specific nodes of Canadian engagement with the region.

 The data created through this role will further develop our understanding of the rich web of connections linking people and places in Canada and Asia. These connections may be cultural, economic, diplomatic, etc. Some examples of datasets we hope to augment or develop include:


 Foreign direct investment

Canadian culture in Asia (sports, music, etc.)
Asian culture in Canada (food, music, language, etc.)
Student exchanges, study-abroad experiences, university partnerships

 Many of the datasets we are considering come from one or more open or internal sources but will require considerable thought and effort regarding selection, validation, transformation, and formatting to be ready for integration with CAST. It's critical that the datasets being developed are maintainable and updatable, so a large part of the work will focus on setting up automated data transformation/validation pipelines within an appropriate software framework such as Node, Python, PHP, R, PostgreSQL, etc.
 Another key task for this role will be to maintain and extend our database of Canadian and Asian sub-national jurisdictions in collaboration with our regional specialists.

 be eligible to work in Canada and be either a student or have graduated from a Canadian post-secondary institution with either a Ph.D. or master's degree within the past 24 months of the application deadline of Sunday, August 7, 2022 (at 11:59 p.m. PT).
and as part of our legal obligation under the Occupational Health and Safety Act (OHSA) and consistent with our Vaccination Policy, APF Canada requires all staff and future staff to be dual-vaccinated. Such vaccination requirement is subject to APF Canada's duty to accommodate under applicable human rights legislation.



 Skills & Experience

We are working both in the office and remotely on a hybrid schedule, and the JRS/PGRS will ideally be available for regular in-office collaboration in either city. However strong applications from elsewhere in Canada may be considered.
 The start date is flexible, though we hope to fill the position quickly, with a grant agreement initially lasting one year. There is a possibility to extend the grant agreement until March 31, 2024.

 Major Responsibilities


 Audit existing datasets for accuracy/validity/completeness and make updates as necessary
Collect and format new datasets in close collaboration with topic or region specialists

 Investissement étranger direct
Collaborations de recherche universitaire publiées
Communautés de la diaspora asiatique au Canada
Commerce des matières premières et chaînes d’approvisionnement
