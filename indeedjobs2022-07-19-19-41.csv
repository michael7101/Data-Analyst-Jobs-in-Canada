 Sustainability, Relationships & Impact (SRI) is a new business unit focused on reinventing partnerships, driving ATB's commitment to sustainability and empowering Albertans. We generate long-term, systemic value for ATB's stakeholders by embedding environmental, social and governance (ESG) principles into ATB’s strategic and operational planning practices. The teams within SRI include Third Party Relationships (composed of Procurement, Vendor Oversight, Third Party Risk Management), Social Impact, Legal Services & Governance, and Insights & Enablement.
 The Insights & Enablement (I&E) team was established in April 2020 to lead and execute strategic/operating initiatives for teams within the Corporate Operations department at ATB. In early 2022, when the new SRI business unit was announced, several Corporate Operations teams, including I&E, transitioned to SRI. 
The I&E team is now primarily responsible for leading and executing strategic/operating initiatives for the SRI business unit. SRI initiatives range from small to large, with many initiatives spanning multiple departments or over the entire enterprise. We prioritize projects across SRI with a client-centric mindset while aligning to enterprise goals and resource planning. At the project level, we manage and document progress throughout the project phases starting from intake through discovery, solution refinement, execution and adoption. We’ve developed processes to collaborate cross-functionally with business partners and stakeholders to execute projects from end to end. We utilize an agile methodology to enable us to deliver increments of value to our business partners throughout the fiscal year while minimizing the challenges of supporting various functions.
 We connect and develop people, processes and technology to enable One ATB that can better serve our clients.
