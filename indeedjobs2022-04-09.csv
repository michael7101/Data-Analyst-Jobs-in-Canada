A little bit about Habanero
 Habanero is a Canadian consulting company with offices in Calgary, Toronto, Vancouver and Winnipeg. We are passionate about helping people and organizations thrive. We believe that every organization can be exceptional, and we help to humanize the world of work through the creation of modern workplaces and the cultural, communication, collaboration and content experiences that power them. Our solutions are globally recognized, and we have consecutively ranked as one of Canada's top ten best places to work for the last 11 years. Habanero is proud to be ranked #9 on the Great Place to Work® Canada List of Best Workplaces™ for 2021.
   

The best kind of work
 Habanero is an organization where people who are creative, hard-working, friendly, honest and open come together to do great work. We have a shared passion for solving complex issues that will benefit other people and organizations. We only hire people we can count on, so you can be certain that you are joining a team of happy and competent team members. We service our clients and projects across Canadian time zones and consultants are resourced on cross-regional teams.
   

Supporting each other in personal growth
 We are a lattice organization, meaning that there is no traditional hierarchy. There is no typical boss, and you don’t report to a manager. Instead, we have a more holistic approach to mentorship – we offer employee journey coaches who are there to help you with all things career and life. We believe it’s up to you to make the most out of your career, and we are here to support and encourage you every step of the way.
   

A diverse culture of clever humans
 At Habanero, we celebrate diversity and inclusivity. We are committed to creating and supporting equal employment opportunities regardless of age, race, ancestry, ethnic origin, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, age, marital status, family status or disability. We have included a personalized submission field in our application form to provide an additional opportunity for you to tell your story outside of the traditional resume and cover letter.
   

Compensation
 Our compensation package includes a technology allowance, a wellness allowance, flexible work hours, the option to work from home, health and dental coverage, a health spending account and RRSP matching. We also enjoy smaller perks like free snacks and drinks and group lunches where you can reconnect with your team after a long week. There are training and development opportunities for those who wish to continue evolving their skills. All employees start at three weeks of vacation.
   

Bringing life to work
 Everyone at Habanero probably has their own story around this, but it's probably safe to say that it starts with people feeling like they can bring their whole selves to work. The cornerstone idea is that we want to support people having great lives, not just great work lives (we can't say our relationship begins at 9:00 and ends at 5:00). Other things we've heard make the difference for Habs:
  

People starting their careers get to jump in and gain experience right away
Employee journey support system (career coach)
The culture of trust, transparency, inclusivity, collaboration, autonomy... to name a few
The awesome people that work here (of course)
Flexible work schedule
Training and development opportunities when we can support them


   We recently asked Habs to share what they feel makes us one of the Best Places to Work in Canada and the loudest response was 'our people' (with 'our teams' and 'balance' not far behind).
