   Job Description Summary
 

   The UBC Department of Family Practice (DFP) has established the primary care Innovation Support Unit (ISU) to connect, engage, and partner with those who are actively involved in innovations in primary care. The ISU is initially focused on supporting innovations in community-situated, team-based care (TBC) in BC, which includes initiatives in primary care transformation such as the Patient s Medical Home (PMH) and Primary Care Networks (PCNs) as these are key provincial strategic elements in achieving a sustainable and high-quality community and primary care system in BC. We are working with collaborators at UBC, the Ministry of Health, BC primary care communities and several other groups.
 

 The ISU has several interconnected 
  workstreams related to specific aspects of TBC transformation in Primary Care. Workstreams are a collection of applied, multi-method projects clustering around a particular pressing issue or need in primary care in BC. Workstreams focus on different areas such as: supporting transformation in the primary care system (e.g., designing, testing and deployment of new methods to support change), development of a team-based care evaluation framework and evaluation methods for team-based care; or support for the team based care advisory.
 


   The ISU has been established as a small but nimble and highly networked team, working with many stakeholders. We are currently, looking to hire 1-2 more Research Analysts to support the workstreams.
  
 Analysts will work with workstream leads and ISU faculty, to perform a range of activities including: reviews of literature, support for the Primary Care Transformation workstream in the implementation of primary care transformation tools (e.g. Team and PACC mapping).
 


   We are specifically looking for experience in:
 



     Action Research
   


     Multi-method evaluation (planning and execution)
   


     Quantitative methods to measure changes in behaviour and outcomes in primary care practices
   


     Data visualization
   


     Developing online communities of practice
   


     Coordination
   


     Academic literature reviews
   



   Some of our work will require more familiarity with action research and literature reviews, as well as quantitative and qualitative analysis. Other parts of our work focus more on design thinking, engagement of stakeholders and facilitation.
 


   As the ISU has a Teal organizational structure, the Research Analysts will be responsible for engaging across workstreams as required and as fits the skills of each of the team members. In this way, the ISU works very collaboratively and seeks to match team members to projects / workstreams that build on their strengths and skills. The ISU has opportunities for people with a range of skills and experience to broaden the team’s views as we tackle the complex challenges in primary care. We are looking for diversity and a broad range of experiences to complement other members of the team.
 


   In the ISU we value justice, equity, diversity and inclusion (JEDI) and are working to develop and apply this lens as we work to support primary care systems change. As a team we engage with learning related to the decolonization of research and healthcare systems; team members are expected to have a willingness to learn, unlearn and engage in this work.
  
 Organizational Status
   The Department of Family Practice supports researchers and faculty throughout the province. The ISU is a core unit of the department whose goal is to bring an applied academic lens to the changes that are actively occurring in primary care across the province. The ISU’s initial focus has been on team-based care. The ISU collaborates with the Ministry of Health, Health Authorities, Divisions of Family Practice, communities, and other provincial organizations to develop and link evidence to change initiatives.

Nous sommes une entreprise qui s'enorgueillit d'utiliser la technologie pour faire progresser une industrie autrefois stagnante. Depuis nos débuts en créant une fibre que l'industrie de la bonneterie n'avait jamais utilisée jusqu'à nos efforts continus pour automatiser nos processus de fabrication ; le parcours de Sheertex a pour fil conducteur la volonté d'être innovant dans notre utilisation de la technologie. Même notre méthode de vente directe au consommateur par le biais de nos canaux en ligne n'était pas courante dans l'industrie de la bonneterie et c'est une autre façon pour Sheertex de faire les choses un peu différemment.

Even our method of selling direct-to-consumer through our online channels was uncommon in the hosiery industry, and is just another way Sheertex does things a little differently.
