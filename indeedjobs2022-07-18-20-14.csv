You will have strong experience with Looker and preferably experience in a fast-growing software company. You are excited about the opportunity to be responsible for analytics across multiple subject areas and looking forward to the prospect of mentoring junior analysts.
   




   Our small, collaborative team is responsible for delivering actionable insights across the entirety of Jane, so you are interested in championing a data informed culture across all areas of the business, from marketing to product and everything in between. You are passionate about transparency, accuracy, creating delightful experiences with data, and digging deep in to the ""why."" 
   We want every team at Jane to have the ability to make decisions inspired by data and you will have the opportunity to help make this happen from the ground up.
   




   Like with all positions at Jane, this position is a remote position, allowing you to work anywhere you want across Canada. Building a delighted team who can delight our customers is part of Jane’s DNA, so even though we’re not a strict 9 to 5 environment, we’re working hard to ensure that you also have a life outside of work. We pride ourselves on flexibility & autonomy, and when it comes to decision making, we take a decentralized approach ensuring that our teams' voices aren't just heard, but are acted upon. We're building something special at Jane, and we back that up with an employee stock option plan that ensures that everyone has a chance to share in Jane’s success.
  


 We really want the people who work at Jane to love being here, so it's important that we start off with a bit about what makes our company unique. Here are some specifics about what Jane is all about, and with these, hopefully, you have a better idea if this might be the kind of company you want to be part of.
  


 We’re a North Vancouver-born SaaS company with a distributed remote team across Canada, and our platform is modernizing the world of practice management software. We enable the likes of physiotherapists, mental health counsellors, chiropractors, and other allied health practitioners to run their practices in a digital-first way through features such as online booking, charting, scheduling, secure video, and billing along with an evolving library of features.
  


 Tens of thousands of healthcare practices globally are now running on Jane. In 2021, we processed over 73 million patient appointments, and our scheduling application alone handles more than 10 million API calls per day. Jane is now the number one choice for Allied Healthcare practitioners in Canada. We’re growing quicker in the US than we were here in Canada 3 years ago, and we’re now helping run clinics in 44 countries.
  


 We’re profitable, product-led, and growing organically to the point where 85% of our customer growth is either from customer referrals or word of mouth. Growth like this is unique, especially in the world of SaaS, and it doesn’t happen by chance. We have a brilliant team of over 250 employees who all do an amazing job of listening to our customers, building what they need, and providing industry-leading support.
  


 Last year alone we’ve grown our development team from 36 to 70, and the product team has doubled as a whole. 2022 is going to be a big year for Jane as we’re investing heavily into patient experience with our first patient-facing mobile app, enhancing our telehealth experience, building our own (J)analytics platform, working on global insurance integrations, and introducing new features like HIPAA compliant chat.
  


 Of course, it's not all about the numbers, but this puts into perspective the scale of Jane, from the thousands of practitioners whose lives are made easier each day to the millions of patients receiving treatment. If you’re the type of person excited by this growth, we’d love to speak with you.

 Own several areas of analysis including product and customer lifecycle while working directly with product managers, dev managers and senior leadership to encourage a data-informed culture
 Helping our team build out our new Looker instance, including supporting with documentation, onboarding, training and best practices

  This role would oversee Evaluation Kit and the administration and analysis course surveys. They would be responsible for survey analysis, summary, and dissemination to administration and staff involved in supporting course and program design, which currently is a gap in our processes. The analysis and summary of the course evaluation data will support the college in the following ways: (1) a learning analyst would be able to link quantitative analysis with pedagogy, resulting in more targeted and evidence-based action on curriculum design and student experience; (2) evidence-based understanding of the student experience in individual courses can be shared with faculty, associate deans, and support staff so any issues can be addressed and effective course design practice can be celebrated and encouraged; (3) addressing targeted course design issues supports learner retention (5500 FLEs by 2025) and program/college reputation; (4) faculty requiring extra support to make course updates are identified by associate deans and support/resources prioritized by CTLI; (5) supporting the academic portfolio vitality assessment process, specifically in understanding the quality of curriculum and student experience in each program and across the institution. Furthermore, Evaluation Kit is being underutilized. Having a dedicated person in this role for one year will make it possible to explore automation of some analysis and reporting (e.g., automated dashboards/reports), which supports our college moving towards more operationally efficient, digital practices (operational review). A learning analyst would link quantitative analysis with pedagogy and improve the effective use of the tool.

Mastercard Foundation seeks a world where everyone has the opportunity to learn and prosper. Through its Young Africa Works strategy and Canadian EleV program, the Foundation works with partners to ensure that millions of young people, especially young women, access quality education, financial services, and dignified work. Mastercard Foundation was established in 2006 through the generosity of Mastercard when it became a public company. The Foundation is independent with its own Board of Directors and CEO.
 THE WORK AT THE FOUNDATION 
The Foundation has begun working within Canada in partnership with Indigenous communities and post-secondary institutions to listen, learn, and best understand how we can act in meaningful ways. The EleV strategy was co-created with Indigenous communities, young people, and partners to enable 30,000 Indigenous youth to complete their education and transition to dignified work aligned with their values and aspirations.
 As reflected in Canada's Truth and Reconciliation Commission Calls to Action, education is a key driver of improved socio-economic well-being. Through building partnerships with Indigenous communities, we look to expand our initiative ultimately helping to support a generation of transformative Indigenous young leaders who will be change agents within their communities. We believe that by setting a bold target, we will encourage engagement across sectors and create momentum that will elevate the strengths and opportunities of Indigenous youth. In keeping with our approach, Indigenous communities and young people will be the drivers of this transformation. The program will promote innovations to address longer-term systemic change to achieve economic prosperity and social well-being within Indigenous communities.
 The EleV team oversees current and emerging partnerships related to Indigenous education. Consistent with our overall vision and Youth Africa Works strategy, we will share learnings and opportunities to connect across the work of the Foundation. While operating in distinct contexts, the centrality of youth voice and vision, affirmation of culture and identity, and priority to enhance community capacity for self-determination are common threads upon which our work is strengthened and reinforced.
 UNDERSTANDING AFRICA PROGRAMS AT THE FOUNDATION
 We have entered a very exciting time at the Foundation as we scale up our operations across Africa to realize our Young Africa Works strategy. Our role at the Mastercard Foundation is to be a catalyst. Our Young Africa Works strategy focuses on working with others to spur systemic change so young people have the opportunity to find work that is dignified and fulfilling.
 The Foundation has opened offices in Rwanda, Kenya, Ghana, Senegal, Ethiopia, Nigeria, and Uganda, building a broader leadership presence in Africa to develop specific strategies that support youth employment. Within a country, we work with governments, the private sector, educators, young people, and other funders to improve the quality of education and vocational training, prepare young people for the work force, expand access to financial services for entrepreneurs and small businesses, and connect job seekers to dignified and fulfilling work.
 We are ambitious and driven. Our values transcend and rise above everything else as our guide. We encourage you to bring your bold ideas, curiosity, and expertise to your work. We laugh at ourselves and with each other. We are a team. Our journey together makes our impact even more meaningful.

 The Asia Pacific Foundation of Canada (APFC) is looking to hire a full-time Junior Research Scholar (JRS) or Post-Graduate Research Scholar (PGRS) with a specialty in data analysis to work on gathering, transforming, and preparing data on sub-national connections between Canada and the Asia-Pacific. This role will support the development of the Canada Asia Sustainability Tracker (CAST). CAST is an online, interactive platform for mapping and visualizing developments in the Asia Pacific with respect to specific nodes of Canadian engagement with the region.

 The data created through this role will further develop our understanding of the rich web of connections linking people and places in Canada and Asia. These connections may be cultural, economic, diplomatic, etc. Some examples of datasets we hope to augment or develop include:


 Foreign direct investment
Published academic research collaborations
Asian diaspora communities in Canada
Commodities trade and supply chains
Canada's educational diaspora
Canadian culture in Asia (sports, music, etc.)
Asian culture in Canada (food, music, language, etc.)
Student exchanges, study-abroad experiences, university partnerships
Canadian businesses with locations in Asia
Diplomatic missions and trade offices
Trans-pacific NGOs



 Many of the datasets we are considering come from one or more open or internal sources but will require considerable thought and effort regarding selection, validation, transformation, and formatting to be ready for integration with CAST. It's critical that the datasets being developed are maintainable and updatable, so a large part of the work will focus on setting up automated data transformation/validation pipelines within an appropriate software framework such as Node, Python, PHP, R, PostgreSQL, etc.
 Another key task for this role will be to maintain and extend our database of Canadian and Asian sub-national jurisdictions in collaboration with our regional specialists.

 The application deadline is Sunday, August 7 (at 11:59 p.m. PST). Applications will be accepted on a rolling basis until the position is filled; you are encouraged to submit your application as soon as you are ready.

 Eligibility

 Applicants must


 be eligible to work in Canada and be either a student or have graduated from a Canadian post-secondary institution with either a Ph.D. or master's degree within the past 24 months of the application deadline of Sunday, August 7, 2022 (at 11:59 p.m. PT).
and as part of our legal obligation under the Occupational Health and Safety Act (OHSA) and consistent with our Vaccination Policy, APF Canada requires all staff and future staff to be dual-vaccinated. Such vaccination requirement is subject to APF Canada's duty to accommodate under applicable human rights legislation.



 Skills & Experience

 Applicants should be able to demonstrate


 experience working with complex datasets using modern programming languages, data tools, and methods
ability to write clear, concise code and share examples, e.g. through a GitHub profile or similar.
detail-oriented approach to data management



 Other skills and experience that will be considered beneficial:


 Experience with JavaScript /web development
Knowledge and experience of the Asia Pacific, including languages
Experience working with GIS and open geospatial data (e.g. OpenStreetMap, Wikidata)



 Location & Start Date

 We offer a friendly and flexible work environment from our offices based in Toronto and Vancouver. We are working both in the office and remotely on a hybrid schedule, and the JRS/PGRS will ideally be available for regular in-office collaboration in either city. However strong applications from elsewhere in Canada may be considered.
 The start date is flexible, though we hope to fill the position quickly, with a grant agreement initially lasting one year. There is a possibility to extend the grant agreement until March 31, 2024.

 Major Responsibilities


 Audit existing datasets for accuracy/validity/completeness and make updates as necessary
Collect and format new datasets in close collaboration with topic or region specialists
Automate data update/validation workflows in consultation with the CAST development team
Work with the APFC research team to identify potential topics/areas for new datasets
Provide support to various ongoing research initiatives as needed
Assist with other duties as assigned in support of APFC



 Term & Compensation

 La Fondation Asie Pacifique du Canada (FAP Canada) est à la recherche d’un chercheur de cycle supérieur à temps plein, spécialisé en analyse de données, pour travailler à la collecte, la transformation et la préparation de données sur les liens infranationaux entre le Canada et l’Asie-Pacifique. Ce rôle permettra de soutenir le déploiement du Suivi de la durabilité Canada-Asie (CAST). CAST est une plateforme interactive en ligne servant à cartographier et à visualiser les développements en Asie Pacifique particulièrement marqués par une implication canadienne.

 Les données créées dans le cadre de ce rôle nous permettront de mieux comprendre le réseau dense de liens entre les personnes et les lieux au Canada et en Asie. Ces liens peuvent être culturels, économiques, diplomatiques, etc. Voici quelques exemples d’ensembles de données que nous espérons enrichir ou étoffer :


 Investissement étranger direct
Collaborations de recherche universitaire publiées
Communautés de la diaspora asiatique au Canada
Commerce des matières premières et chaînes d’approvisionnement
Diaspora éducative du Canada

Culture asiatique au Canada (nourriture, musique, langue, etc.).
Échanges d’étudiants, expériences d’études à l’étranger, partenariats universitaires
Entreprises canadiennes implantées en Asie
Missions diplomatiques et bureaux commerciaux
ONG transpacifiques



 Bon nombre des ensembles de données que nous examinons proviennent d’une ou de plusieurs sources ouvertes ou internes, mais nécessiteront une réflexion et des efforts considérables en matière de sélection, de validation, de transformation et de formatage afin d’être prêts à être intégrés à la plateforme CAST. Il est essentiel que les ensembles de données créés puissent être maintenus et mis à jour. Une grande partie du travail consistera donc à mettre en place des pipelines automatisés de transformation/validation des données dans un cadre logiciel approprié tel que Node, Python, PHP, R, PostgreSQL, etc.

 Le maintien et l’expansion de notre base de données des administrations infranationales canadiennes et asiatiques, en collaboration avec nos spécialistes régionaux, constituent une autre tâche essentielle du poste.

 La date limite de dépôt des candidatures est le dimanche 7 août (à 23 h 59 HP). Les candidatures seront acceptées sur une base continue jusqu’à ce que le poste soit pourvu; nous vous encourageons à soumettre votre candidature dès que vous êtes prêt.
