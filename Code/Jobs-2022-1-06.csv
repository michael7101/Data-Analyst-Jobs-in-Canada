Our story
Making a difference to our clients with forward-looking, quality research has always been at the heart of our business. Wood Mackenzie started life in 1923 as a small, relatively unknown, Edinburgh-based stockbroker. By the 1970s, we had become one of the top three stockbrokers in the UK, renowned for the quality of its equity research.

Our success has always been underpinned by the clear and simple principle of providing trusted research and advice that would make a difference to clients. This was true when the first oil report was published by our equity analysts in 1973, and remains just as relevant to us today.

So much so that, over the past four decades, we have drawn upon our heritage to create a global research and consultancy business that has grown alongside the needs of its clients.

Having cultivated deep expertise in upstream oil and gas, we carefully broadened our focus to deliver the same level of detailed insight for every interconnected sector of the energy, chemicals, metals and mining industries we now serve around the world.

But heritage is more than just history.

Our expert analysts and consultants have connected us to some of the most significant events of our time – creating insight for governments, boards and CEOs who have helped shape the future direction of the world's natural resources industries and their impact on society.

Today we are part of the Verisk family which has broadened our data and analytics platform and strengthened our ability to provide intelligence that helps drive growth and serve thousands of industry market leaders.

What endures is our focus on delivering excellent, forward-looking research,which underpins the analysis and advice we offer, and the knowledge that our success is intrinsically linked to the needs of our clients'​.",Information Services,Analyst,false,LISTED,Full-time,https://www.linkedin.com/job-apply/3271782079

The social well-being of the Carrier and Sekani people needed improvement and it was time to begin on a new path- one that would lead their member nations to a better place and a solid future.  The CSTC took their first step on this path by employing eight people to support Carrier and Sekani families to navigate the Child Welfare system.  In addition, they saw the need to have a patient advocate for Carrier people at the University Hospital of Northern British Columbia.

Based on their vision on August 1990, a non-profit society was established to provide social welfare supports, legal guidance, and research to Indigenous people living in remote and urban areas in Northern BC’s central region.  The non-profit was named Northern Native Family Services. In later years it was re-named Carrier Sekani Family Services (CSFS). CSFS signed its first transfer agreement in 1997 to provide community-based health programs.  As the service needs in child welfare, social, health and legal programs were on the rise; these areas became the development priorities for the agency.  Landmark events began with the incorporation of a small office and a handful of employees, and with the guidance of a board of directors, the society moved forward.

Today, CSFS is a leading organization with more than 280 skilled staff members in Prince George, Vanderhoof, Fort St. James and Burns Lake. 

CSFS is committed to a strong foundation in Carrier and Sekani values, beliefs and philosophies.
