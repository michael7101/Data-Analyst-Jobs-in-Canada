Our story
Making a difference to our clients with forward-looking, quality research has always been at the heart of our business. Wood Mackenzie started life in 1923 as a small, relatively unknown, Edinburgh-based stockbroker. By the 1970s, we had become one of the top three stockbrokers in the UK, renowned for the quality of its equity research.

Our success has always been underpinned by the clear and simple principle of providing trusted research and advice that would make a difference to clients. This was true when the first oil report was published by our equity analysts in 1973, and remains just as relevant to us today.

So much so that, over the past four decades, we have drawn upon our heritage to create a global research and consultancy business that has grown alongside the needs of its clients.

Having cultivated deep expertise in upstream oil and gas, we carefully broadened our focus to deliver the same level of detailed insight for every interconnected sector of the energy, chemicals, metals and mining industries we now serve around the world.

But heritage is more than just history.

Our expert analysts and consultants have connected us to some of the most significant events of our time – creating insight for governments, boards and CEOs who have helped shape the future direction of the world's natural resources industries and their impact on society.

Today we are part of the Verisk family which has broadened our data and analytics platform and strengthened our ability to provide intelligence that helps drive growth and serve thousands of industry market leaders.

What endures is our focus on delivering excellent, forward-looking research,which underpins the analysis and advice we offer, and the knowledge that our success is intrinsically linked to the needs of our clients'​.",Information Services,Analyst,false,LISTED,Full-time,,

As a team, we are working to set new standards on how to build and run solar energy sites at peak efficiency. As we continue to scale in 2022, we’re looking for more entry-level Data Analyst & Report Specialist’s to join our diverse remote-first team. This is a unique opportunity to start your career as an Analyst in the renewable energy industry.
What We're Building:
Roughly 70% of global power still comes from non-renewable polluting energy sources. As a climate-friendly and cost-effective energy solution, solar has the potential to drastically reduce our global CO2 emissions, helping to meet the World’s climate obligations for a clean energy transition. However, getting sites up and running is only the beginning. Once solar projects are built, many factors can interfere with performance. What we know from a recent industry report is that solar projects are underperforming by up to 6.3% on average. This number may seem inconsequential, but if these facilities continually perform shy of targets, this could interfere with private investment causing a ripple effect. Aligning financial risk and reward with low-carbon energy investments is critical for shifting the economy in the direction of reduced emissions. Without substantial private sector investment in clean energy, it will be more difficult, more costly, and more time-consuming to address climate change on a global scale.
At Heliolytics, we’re working with our client partners to close that performance gap in order to enable a sustainable transition to clean energy and secure the future of our industry. We’re building a suite of industry-leading tools and services to enable our clients, which include some of the largest solar energy producers in the world, to maximize their energy output each year. Every marginal increase in efficiency is a huge win for our team, our client partners, and the environment. To date, our optimizations have resulted in increased energy production equivalent to 130,500 car-years of CO2 reductions.
Our Analysis & Reporting Team:
We manage our entire workflow in-house, from gathering imagery data using industry-leading tools and techniques to providing clear, actionable insights for clients to make the best decisions for their renewable energy assets. Our Analysis & Reporting Team plays an instrumental role in ensuring that the collected solar field data is processed correctly, and turned into clear, consistent deliverables for our clients.
As an Analyst, You Will:
Onboard client assets into our internal systemsAnalyze collected field imagery and resulting anomaly distribution, suggest potential issues and remediation for client assetsIdentify trends across client portfolios and ensure that these are communicated through our reportsReview data with our technical experts and write client reportsCreate other client deliverables using specialized software toolsComplete tasks related to our analysis workflow, such as database management, troubleshooting and consulting projects

Additionally, you’ll gain insight into:
The North American and global renewable energy industriesSolar (PV) system components, layouts, and maintenanceProcessing and presenting spatial datasets

What You Bring:
An interest in aerial imagery interpretationA keen eye for detail and a commitment to high quality standardsExperience working on analysis-related projects (Internship & Academic experience considered)Experience working on projects with tight timelines, multiple stakeholders, or other complexities (Internship & Academic experience considered)Demonstrated ability to learn and adapt to new software technologies, and experience with broadly-used software packages (Adobe suite, Excel, Google suite, etc)A resourceful approach to problem solving A collaborative approach to communication and a genuine interest in the success and growth of the people you work withA passion for sustainability and an interest in renewable energy

Bonus Points:
Imagery interpretation experience (satellite-based imagery analysis, or aerial photo interpretation)GIS software or packages or geospatial analysis (note: this is not a GIS technician position)Some experience with Python or programming languages (Analysts regularly interact with our Development team)Experience with scientific classification schemes

Working at Heliolytics
Heliolytics is a mosaic of talented people with different interests and goals united by our mission to build a sustainable transition to clean energy. As a remote-first organization, we work hard to optimize all of our systems and processes to operate remotely whenever possible, however, we do like to meet in person on occasion.

We service and partner with solar owners, operators, developers, EPCs, financiers, equipment providers, insurers, asset managers, and independent engineers to optimize portfolio management of solar assets.

Heliolytics aerial inspection services use proprietary aircraft-based sensors to collect high-definition infrared and visual images of all modules on a site. This imagery is post-processed with our in-house imagery analysis software suite to provide accurate maps of fault locations and definitions. These images are analyzed by our PV experts to detect current failures, decipher potential failure modes, and determine the root cause of system faults. On average, we detect $23 million USD worth of annual recoverable revenue for our clients, which corresponds to an average energy loss of 1.2% not otherwise identified by current O&M practices.

Our services provide many benefits to our clients, including optimization of system performance, proactive mitigation of risk, tracking DC performance, reducing O&M costs, and increasing site safety.

Darkhorse Analytics is an Edmonton-based consulting firm specializing in predictive analytics and data visualization. Our visualization team is internationally recognized for building custom interactive visualizations with a focus on impact and clarity. But our company first began with Darkhorse Emergency.

Darkhorse Emergency provides software and custom analytics for fire, EMS and police services to make data-driven decisions and better serve their communities. What began as a loose collection of Excel spreadsheets and Ph.D. thesis Matlab code has evolved into an ecosystem of database-driven web apps and best practices. We work with clients to provide them with bespoke software and advisory services.

Every client is different. The interpretation of their data and unique needs requires strong analytical skills.

What you'll be doing

Work at Darkhorse Emergency is diverse and ever-changing. We implement our proprietary software and solve interesting and challenging business problems for a wide variety of fire and emergency clients.

You will work to understand our clients' data and bring it into our proprietary software and provide them with an in-depth analysis that highlights root causes and opportunities. You will work with a team of analysts and take part in the project life cycle from start to finish, including:
Gathering and interpreting Fire and EMS data. Our data can come from different sources, including client tools and open databases, as well as flat files. Bringing data together in our databases will be a big part of what you do here. Data cleaning and summary analysis. Data is rarely what you want it to be. Cleaning and understanding your inputs are the first required step in any quantitative project. Implementing our Darkhorse Emergency Platform. Matching clients' unique data to the fields required for our platform is a crucial step, and requires business context as well as technical savvy. Validating findings and stories in the data. Do your findings pass the smell check? A mix of experience, expertise and creativity is required to validate your findings and distinguish the right signals from data errors. Creating stunning data visualizations. Using tools like QGIS, Jupyter Notebooks or even Excel, you will work with the data to create visually engaging visualizations and maps to clarify our findings. Creating succinct presentations and reports. Often times our analyses need to be translated into a report that is readable, actionable, and isn't going to collect dust on the shelf. We believe less is more, and we take the time to make it succinct. Translating client needs into achievable solutions. Using your understanding of the industry and the client's unique challenges, you will provide our clients with actionable recommendations.

You are a wizard with data, and comfortable using some combination of Excel, SQL, and Python. You ideally have some experience using GIS tools like QGIS to visualize data geographically. Ideally, you have experience with the Fire and Emergency Management industry, and are familiar with municipal datasets, city planning, land use zoning, etc. A strong desire to learn is also acceptable. You genuinely enjoy problem-solving and finding patterns. The harder the challenge, the harder it is to put it down until you crack it. You are intrigued by a career in consulting and data analysis. You believe that being constantly pushed out of your comfort zone is a thrilling opportunity. You are able to focus on the most critical parts. In a haystack of data, you are able to find the needle that can pinpoint issues or root causes. You can communicate well. Having the correct analytical solution is one thing, but you should also be able to develop your solution methodically and explain the whole thing to your grandmother in the end. You are motivated and comfortable immersing yourself in data and understanding the message behind it. You can be skeptical about your findings if they don't seem correct.
