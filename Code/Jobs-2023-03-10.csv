THE COMPANY
B-Stock is the world's largest B2B recommerce marketplace for excess [or surplus] merchandise. Businesses of all sizes leverage the B-Stock platform to sell and buy customer returns, overstock and other excess merchandise - ranging from top brands and retailers who want best-in-class inventory management to entrepreneurs looking to source valuable merchandise for their resale businesses.
Tens of thousands of small business owners all over the globe use B-Stock to launch and power their resale business. We take pride in empowering these innovators and entrepreneurs of commerce.
In 2020 we sold 120 million items across our platform, giving a second life to this otherwise would be “waste” merchandise. In fact, we kept 400 million pounds of goods in use and saved millions from the landfill. It feels good to be B-Stock!
The amount of returned or unsold inventory continues to grow each year, and in 2020, it was estimated at over $1 trillion worth worldwide. We know there is tremendous value in and demand for this inventory - no matter the category, condition, or location. The B-Stock platform gives buyers a simple way to buy brand-name merchandise directly from top retailers and manufacturers. At the same time, we offer companies an automated, trusted replacement for traditional liquidation while boosting operational efficiency, recovery rates, and cycle time.
Led by eBay veterans and backed by top investors including Spectrum Equity, True Ventures, and Susquehanna Growth Equity, B-Stock shows no signs of slowing down. Our core values have shaped the company we are today and will continue to drive our success for many years to come.

OUR VALUES
Make Each Dollar Count Whether it’s the recovery amount or a buyer’s budget, money matters to all of our clients. And because each dollar matters to them, it matters to us.
Take Our Work Seriously, Not OurselvesEverything at B-Stock continues to grow - everything but our egos, that is. We’re not afraid to let loose and laugh (often at ourselves).
Do The Hard Things Today That Will Pay Off TomorrowWe’re willing to sacrifice and endure, fail and adapt to reach our long-term goals. 
Use Trust As The Best Measure Of SuccessThe trust we earn along the way is more valuable than money. Without trust from both our buyers and sellers, our business won’t succeed.
Find Strength In NumbersUse our passion for data to provide value to our customers, improve ourselves, and develop new ways to delight our buyers and sellers.


No applicant will face discrimination/harassment based on race, color, ancestry, national origin, religion, age, gender, marital domestic partner status, sexual orientation, gender identity, disability status, or veteran status. Above and beyond discrimination/harassment based on “protected categories,” B-Stock also strives to prevent other, subtler forms of inappropriate behavior (e.g., stereotyping) from ever gaining a foothold in our office. Whether blatant or hidden, barriers to success have no place at B-Stock.

How about Kansas City? That’s our home. That’s where Garmin put a stake in the ground in 1989. We’ve grown substantially over the years, offering diverse products and global reach in 5 diverse markets. But some things won’t ever change: Our entrepreneurial spirit and a culture where everyone’s opinion matters. That’s because we believe it’s possible to light the tech world on fire and still be on a first name basis.

BIG IDEAS, SMALL EGOS
What we do best is make products that let our customers do what they love. To do that, we focus on practical innovation, never losing sight of the benefits our products bring to our customers. Sure, we love bells and whistles. What leading technology company doesn't? But we make sure ours have purpose. It’s not about the things we make. It’s about the things we make possible.

WE’RE GLOBAL, SERIOUSLY.
Yeah, we’re based in Kansas City, but we are truly a global company. With offices throughout Europe, Asia, Middle East, South America and Australia, our products are sold all over the world. One elevator ride at our headquarters and you’re likely to hear 4 (or more) different languages being spoken. At Garmin, we may act local, but we think global.

DREAM BIG. SLEEP WELL.
At Garmin, we like to encourage dreamers. But at some point it’s nice to wake up and enjoy a fully aware life. So we make it super easy to achieve a good balance between working, dreaming and enjoying life—from workout classes offered throughout the day, breaks to get out and move on our campus, and wellness programs offered throughout the year.

Our clients offer top-tier pay for top-tier talent. We're recruiting this role for our client, Forward Kitchens. Have you got what it takes?
On-demand food delivery is the future of restaurants. However, most restaurants are either ill-equipped or unaware of how to unlock their full delivery revenue potential through digitization. A restaurant’s digital presence could be the difference between a viral hit like Salt Bae’s booming global steak empire (which is just ok, if you ask us) and your favorite mom-and-pop hole-in-the-wall that went out of business during the pandemic.
That’s where Forward Kitchens comes in. We empower restaurants to create multiple digital storefronts to generate more online sales and increase their bottom line – all without having to hire a creative marketing team or deal with the millions (we’re exaggerating) of delivery platforms out there. We believe in our partner restaurants’ power to represent their communities and provide delicious, eclectic meals to their ever-ravenous customers at scale.
This role is your gateway into our business and into the tech startup scene in general.

Description

CloudBees provides the leading software delivery platform for enterprises, enabling them to continuously innovate, compete, and win in a world powered by the digital experience. Designed for the world's largest organizations with the most complex requirements, CloudBees enables software development organizations to deliver scalable, compliant, governed, and secure software from the code a developer writes to the people who use it. The platform connects with other best-of-breed tools, improves the developer experience, and enables organizations to bring digital innovation to life continuously, adapt quickly, and unlock business outcomes that create market leaders and disruptors.

CloudBees was founded in 2010 and is backed by Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, Bridgepoint Credit, HSBC, Golub Capital, Delta-v Capital, Matrix Partners, and Lightspeed Venture Partners. Visit www.cloudbees.com and follow us on Twitter, LinkedIn, and Facebook.

About The Role

It’s an exciting time to join the CloudBees team because thousands of development and deployment teams around the world are using our products to enhance and optimize the way their teams build and deliver software using continuous delivery.

To support the delivery of CloudBees products (both internal and external), our Operations team designs, deploys, secures and manages a variety of software systems and the related GCP / AWS infrastructure that underpins these software engineering objectives. Our guiding principle is simple - “Make Engineering Faster”. Underpinning this are the challenges of security, process change, technical change that all must be met to varying degrees. Further, we are passionate about reducing the manual work that plagues IT teams - Engineering / Ops / Support / Security - and are empowered to re-engineer processes (more easily said than done) and technology to achieve those objectives.

Our preferred candidate will be located in a US/CAN Eastern Standard Time zone to provide the best working hour coverage for our Engineering and Operations workloads.

We are looking for someone who: 

Will bring new ideas from where you’ve worked in the past - what worked well, what didn’t work, and help us understand what CloudBees could do better. Has “the knack” - an uncanny ability to uncover the root cause of problems based on limited information because “it feels like something you’ve seen before”.Has no fear of saying - “Have you considered doing it this way” - and giving constructive feedback to colleagues on alternative ways of doing things.And, the courage to say - “I’m not sure” - and seeks feedback from your colleagues on how to complete a task in our tech-stack.

You are:

self-motivated and enjoy solving problemsexcited by the opportunity to automate yourself out of recurring workable to keep tickets up to date, so we don’t need too many status meetings (we’re async first due to our distributed nature)You will liaise directly with the software engineers across all teams, ensuring that decisions are agreed internally and externally to Operations and that they meet our technical and non-technical objectives.

How you’ll work:

In a geographically distributed team (APAC, US, EMEA) of peersChoose your own work in tandem with the team, team-leader, and managerReport directly to the Operations Manager (who reports to the VP of Engineering)Flexible working hours - while there will be some core hours required for meeting with Engineering and Operations teams - much latitude is given in getting work done. This includes determining your own start and finish times to accommodate family life.Limited travel (especially at the moment) - but once things return to normal (whatever that looks like) we’ll have an annual offsite somewhere on the planetWhat you’ll Do:

Team-building - inside the team and across teams - you’ll be proposing new ideas and helping implement them

Thinking - coming up with new ways of solving problems - and working with the team to prove them out and then implement them

Documenting - describing problems, how your proposed solution solves those problems, and how your implemented solutions are operated.

Optimizing - working with Engineering teams to optimize their build systems - even our monster jobs (lots of parallelism - lots of bottlenecks - lots of technical challenges)

Defining - writing / modifying Terraform to handle our infrastructure, and helping teams define their infrastructure using our modules.

Coding - you’ll be writing code in Golang - we occasionally write glue in Python / Groovy (but not very often)

Securing

working with our security team to drive operational change in engineering teams - “Supply Chain Integrity” - you’ve heard about it - it’s the new hot topicworking with our security team to drive organizational security changes (logging, auditing, monitoring, alerting)

Observing - adding the right monitoring so that we are alerted before our customers notice, and not alerted when the system is able to heal itself

Alerting - getting alerts and working with team members to solve the initial problem, documenting the problem and then working out how to stop them happening again

DevOps / DevSecOps - We’re not “DevOps” engineers, but we do help our teams become more proficient in doing Dev and Ops (and embracing Total Ownership). We build the guard rails to help them do it safely and align tech-stacks across the company.

What you will work on:

IaaS - GCP, AWS, a little AzurePlatform tools - Kubernetes, terraform, helm, dockerLanguage tools - GolangEngineering tools - Jenkins, Vault, CodeShip, Auth0Operations tools - PagerDuty, DataDog

There are a lot more tools - you should ask during your interview!

You have experience in:programming in various languages and domainsthe ""modern Ops stack"" (e.g. monitoring, alerting, cloud-based provisioning, Docker, Kubernetes)Linux systems administrationcloud-based operations (GCP, AWS, or Azure)cluster orchestration and management tools (e.g. k8s / ECS / Terraform / etc)continuous integration / continuous delivery tools (Jenkins / CodeShip etc)modern software engineering practices: code reviews, unit / acceptance testing, source control, etc.using work tools like GSuite, GitHub, Jira, Confluence, and Slack.You are available for occasional On-CallNOTE: No one has been woken up for an outage in over 8 years, there hasn’t been a weekend outage in the last 6 months, and while we have had to triage security vulnerability reports (on weekends), but those have not required work beyond the initial fault analysis. There are occasional false-positives - that are easily silenced - and then resolved at a system level during normal working hours.
We're invested in you!

We offer competitive benefits packages, opportunities for professional development, and more. We also offer generous paid time off to allow our employees time to rest, recharge and to be present with family and friends throughout the year.

At CloudBees, we truly believe that the more diverse we are, the better we serve our customers. A global community like Jenkins demands a global focus from CloudBees.
