THE COMPANY
B-Stock is the world's largest B2B recommerce marketplace for excess [or surplus] merchandise. Businesses of all sizes leverage the B-Stock platform to sell and buy customer returns, overstock and other excess merchandise - ranging from top brands and retailers who want best-in-class inventory management to entrepreneurs looking to source valuable merchandise for their resale businesses.
Tens of thousands of small business owners all over the globe use B-Stock to launch and power their resale business. We take pride in empowering these innovators and entrepreneurs of commerce.
In 2020 we sold 120 million items across our platform, giving a second life to this otherwise would be “waste” merchandise. In fact, we kept 400 million pounds of goods in use and saved millions from the landfill. It feels good to be B-Stock!
The amount of returned or unsold inventory continues to grow each year, and in 2020, it was estimated at over $1 trillion worth worldwide. We know there is tremendous value in and demand for this inventory - no matter the category, condition, or location. The B-Stock platform gives buyers a simple way to buy brand-name merchandise directly from top retailers and manufacturers. At the same time, we offer companies an automated, trusted replacement for traditional liquidation while boosting operational efficiency, recovery rates, and cycle time.
Led by eBay veterans and backed by top investors including Spectrum Equity, True Ventures, and Susquehanna Growth Equity, B-Stock shows no signs of slowing down. Our core values have shaped the company we are today and will continue to drive our success for many years to come.

Take Our Work Seriously, Not OurselvesEverything at B-Stock continues to grow - everything but our egos, that is. We’re not afraid to let loose and laugh (often at ourselves).
Do The Hard Things Today That Will Pay Off TomorrowWe’re willing to sacrifice and endure, fail and adapt to reach our long-term goals. 
Use Trust As The Best Measure Of SuccessThe trust we earn along the way is more valuable than money. Without trust from both our buyers and sellers, our business won’t succeed.
Find Strength In NumbersUse our passion for data to provide value to our customers, improve ourselves, and develop new ways to delight our buyers and sellers.

Above and beyond discrimination/harassment based on “protected categories,” B-Stock also strives to prevent other, subtler forms of inappropriate behavior (e.g., stereotyping) from ever gaining a foothold in our office.

What You'll Do

You will bring your experience and expertise to bear in many facets of the team’s work, but first and foremost you will support Canadian clients by providing data-backed insights into Canadian markets, consumers and industries. These insights will come through analyzing local market data, researching relevant topics,and your first-hand knowledge of Canada. You will use a combination of public data and private data in this work.

Your support to clients will usually take the form of working with McKinsey consulting teams. You will support these teams in their studies. You will do this in a range of ways – sometimes by answering one-off questions, sometimes by joining a consulting team for several weeks to own a more in-depth piece of their project, and other times by adapting models and assets built for the US to use in Canadian projects.

Examples of past projects include supporting a provincial government on an economic growth strategy by assessing regional competitiveness across different sectors; supporting a consumer product company’s marketing strategy by using demographic data to size consumer markets; and analyzing niche markets as inputs into a PE client’s target assessment. Projects also include sharing Canadian data and insights with consulting teams in other countries who want to use Canada as a benchmark.

The second aspect of your role will be to shape our assets and offerings for Canadian markets. You will do this by working closely with your managers to identify opportunities to build knowledge and assets to better support consultants. This could take the form of codified expertise, automated analysis in Tableau or standardized approaches to recurring questions.

Thirdly, as our first hires into Toronto, in many ways you will be the face of our team. You will interact with leaders in the office and region to raise awareness of the team’s new presence and the ways in which we can support their clients.

Who You'll Work With

You’ll work in our Toronto office as part of a research team that supports McKinsey’s clients by providing knowledge, analysis and insights on local Canadian markets.

The team is comprised of about 35 analysts who sit in Boston and San Jose, Costa Rica and support projects across the US and Canada. You will be the first wave of the team’s expansion into Toronto to better support Canadian clients and consulting teams with their research and analytic needs.

You will work closely with teammates in both San Jose and Boston who support Canadian clients today. Our Canadian client base spans multiple sectors (energy, financial services, consumer, public sector, etc.) and you will work with clients and consulting teams across each of those areas.",3468027881,,,,https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/C560BAQE3R7j3w9iR-A/company-logo_400_400/0/1675257361833?e=1684368000&v=beta&t=8kQrEAoEPkC-SkF-UHDOaFpkhROye4-VpZuApjKRLdc,http://www.mckinsey.com/careers/search-jobs/jobs/capabilitiesinsightsanalyst-uscanadaresearch-75110?appsource=LinkedIn,Entry level,197,1598,44305,"McKinsey & Company is a global management consulting firm.

THE COMPANY
B-Stock is the world's largest B2B recommerce marketplace for excess [or surplus] merchandise. Businesses of all sizes leverage the B-Stock platform to sell and buy customer returns, overstock and other excess merchandise - ranging from top brands and retailers who want best-in-class inventory management to entrepreneurs looking to source valuable merchandise for their resale businesses.
Tens of thousands of small business owners all over the globe use B-Stock to launch and power their resale business. We take pride in empowering these innovators and entrepreneurs of commerce.
In 2020 we sold 120 million items across our platform, giving a second life to this otherwise would be “waste” merchandise. In fact, we kept 400 million pounds of goods in use and saved millions from the landfill. It feels good to be B-Stock!
The amount of returned or unsold inventory continues to grow each year, and in 2020, it was estimated at over $1 trillion worth worldwide. We know there is tremendous value in and demand for this inventory - no matter the category, condition, or location. The B-Stock platform gives buyers a simple way to buy brand-name merchandise directly from top retailers and manufacturers. At the same time, we offer companies an automated, trusted replacement for traditional liquidation while boosting operational efficiency, recovery rates, and cycle time.
Led by eBay veterans and backed by top investors including Spectrum Equity, True Ventures, and Susquehanna Growth Equity, B-Stock shows no signs of slowing down. Our core values have shaped the company we are today and will continue to drive our success for many years to come.

OUR VALUES
Make Each Dollar Count Whether it’s the recovery amount or a buyer’s budget, money matters to all of our clients. And because each dollar matters to them, it matters to us.
Take Our Work Seriously, Not OurselvesEverything at B-Stock continues to grow - everything but our egos, that is. We’re not afraid to let loose and laugh (often at ourselves).
Do The Hard Things Today That Will Pay Off TomorrowWe’re willing to sacrifice and endure, fail and adapt to reach our long-term goals. 
Use Trust As The Best Measure Of SuccessThe trust we earn along the way is more valuable than money. Without trust from both our buyers and sellers, our business won’t succeed.
Find Strength In NumbersUse our passion for data to provide value to our customers, improve ourselves, and develop new ways to delight our buyers and sellers.


No applicant will face discrimination/harassment based on race, color, ancestry, national origin, religion, age, gender, marital domestic partner status, sexual orientation, gender identity, disability status, or veteran status. Above and beyond discrimination/harassment based on “protected categories,” B-Stock also strives to prevent other, subtler forms of inappropriate behavior (e.g., stereotyping) from ever gaining a foothold in our office. Whether blatant or hidden, barriers to success have no place at B-Stock.
