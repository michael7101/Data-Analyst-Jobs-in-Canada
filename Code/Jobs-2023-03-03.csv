This includes “gigs” ranging from rideshare drivers and food couriers, all the way to freelance designers and general laborers. The gig economy has provided people everywhere with new opportunities to pursue their independence, achieve work-life balance, and earn good money while doing it.

But these opportunities have also come with some challenges. Independent gig workers are responsible for buying and maintaining their own equipment and are not provided with the same financial security as salaried employees. This means there’s a level of financial uncertainty for gig workers today that can make the pursuit of independence seem daunting.

Hi there!
We're looking for an experienced, hands-on Cloud Security Engineer to join our Security Zone at Zapier and help us to build a comfy stronghold. Zapier is on a mission to democratize automation. Over 5 million professionals already use Zapier to save more time, but there are millions more to reach. We owe it to our customers to be a responsible steward of their data and keep it safe and private.
Are you interested in working with a team that thrives on ownership where you go default to action on your ideas and own them from start to finish? And you are happy to grab the keyboard and implement your ideas? Do you want to be part of a growing cloud security program for a fast-growing and powerful automation tool, called Zapier? Then read on…
To help share a bit more about life at Zapier, here are a few resources:
 Our Commitment to Applicants  Culture and Values at Zapier  Zapier Guide to Remote Work  Zapier Code of Conduct  Diversity and Inclusivity at Zapier  About You
You have deep cloud infrastructure security experience. Keeping the cloud resources that support our core Zapier application secure is at the heart of this role. Zapier is a SaaS product, so experience building software and administering cloud infrastructure under a similar model is a must. Working in a SOC2 and/or ISO27001 or HIPAA/HITRUST compliant environment is a plus.
You have worked with teams before on large Python, AWS, & Kubernetes projects. You’re also familiar with some common frameworks such as Django, Flask, or Rails. You've also worked extensively in AWS. Deep knowledge in working with Kubernetes or other containerization technologies are a big plus.
Maybe you’re not a security engineer, but an experienced cloud infrastructure engineer or devops engineer with security in your heart. You have deep cloud infrastructure experience, have hands-on knowledge about the tech mentioned above and would like to move to the security field.
You're a doer. You have managed complex cloud security infrastructures with minimal guidance. Familiarity with the AWS (or other cloud infrastructure) security best practices frameworks and how to utilize it for enhancing the security of a cloud environment.
You love to collaborate, give a hand when needed. In this role you're not going to be just an advisor, you can and will get your hands dirty. You love to work with others, to give and take feedback and work together on a vision to raise the security maturity.
You are friendly and patient, welcoming, considerate, and respectful. Learn more about these attributes in our code of conduct .
Things You Might Do
That Said, Here Are Some Things You'll Probably Do
Zapier is a fast-growing, and remote-first company, so you'll likely get experience on many different projects across the organization.
 You will take ownership of parts of the CloudSec Program, focused around an ever evolving security maturity model that help us to prioritize our work and improve our cloud security. If you like this or this , you will find this role very interesting.  lYou will take ownership of the AWS organizations setup, the SSO permissions model and connected areas (eg. terraform), but not exclusively work in this area  For cross-team projects you might work shoulder to shoulder embedded into our SRE team.  This is a hands-on role, so you'll write some python and work within terraform, AWS and more. If you love automation, you will love this role.  Identify where we can add more layers of defense in depth and implement them.  Build internal tooling to ensure safe data access patterns for Zapier employees.  Locating weak points across Zapier and strengthening them. 
You’ll also have the opportunity to specialize in a variety of areas of the Zapier IaC codebase, including core platform development. Focusing on a specialization will not limit your area for growth at Zapier as each engineer brings a unique perspective and can contribute differently in all areas. We encourage participation and will frequently have engineers contribute across teams to assist in projects.
Things We've Done Recently
 Implemented a comprehensive Cloud Security Posture Management system  Rolled out a training platform for our Security Champions  Deleted all our IAM users to rely on SSO instead  Implemented a successful bug bounty program  Conducted dozens of threat modeling sessions  Zapier Compensation Guiding Principles
Here’s How We Define Our Compensation Principles
