Founded in 2019, BC Rent Bank was established to support existing rent banks, provide seed funding and support for new sites, and ultimately create an infrastructure that would support a province-wide rent bank system. Having accomplished that original mandate, BC Rent Bank is now shifting its focus to ongoing support of that province-wide system through funding, resources, and professional development. There are currently 18 rent banks in BC. 

A rent bank is a homelessness prevention and housing stability program focused on supporting low-moderate income renters who face a temporary crisis. In addition to providing financial support, rent banks also provide secondary supports such a landlord mediation, access to financial literacy, food banks, and other community resources aimed at creating greater housing stability. 

The Role: Data Analysis and Research Officer 

The Data and Research Officer for BC Rent Bank is responsible for supporting the project by providing analytical and technical support and advice. It is expected that this role work closely with the Managing Director of BC Rent Bank to collect, analyze and report on data that will communicate the impact of rent banks in the prevention of homelessness across BC. Indirectly, the role will collaborate with BC Rent Bank’s non-profit partners to ensure data collection and reporting methods are consistent and will also connect with Vancity Community Foundation staff engaged in research and advocacy. 

This role will be responsible to look at current data collection methods and metrics, and work to improve the tools and resources used within the rent bank network to gather this information. This role will work with rent bank partners to ensure that data is entered consistently within the Client Management System (CMS), and make recommendations for technology improvements. As well, this role will oversee quarterly and annual reporting done by rent bank partners, improving reporting tools as needed, and collating data to be included in larger project reports. This role will help to develop data collection methods that reflect the impact of rent banks in people’s housing stability, and support the project and our partners in gathering that data and then producing reports that tell the story of impact.

 Vos collaborateurs 

Des milliards de fois par jour, les ordinateurs du monde entier communiquent avec le nuage de Cisco Secure Endpoint et s’appuient sur nos produits pour les protéger contre les formes avancées de logiciels malveillants. Certains logiciels malveillants sont simples à détecter, et les antivirus le font depuis toujours. Nos clients ont besoin d'être protégés contre les logiciels malveillants plus difficiles à détecter :
 Des virus qui génèrent des fichiers binaires différents sur chaque machine qu’ils infectent  Des choses qui semblent bénignes jusqu’à ce que vous commenciez à examiner de près leur comportement  Les concepteurs de logiciels malveillants qui ont inventé de nouvelles façons de se dissimuler. 

Pour rendre le problème encore plus haletant, cela peut prendre quelques jours pour s'apercevoir qu'un programme ou un comportement est malveillant. Est-ce que cela vous amuserait?

Notre équipe cultive une approche collaborative et judicieuse du développement et des tests. C'est l'occasion de faire partie d'une équipe qui a à la fois de nouvelles idées et des années d'expérience dans le développement de logiciels en réseau très performants et à haute disponibilité dans un des secteurs les plus fascinants et surprenants : la sécurité informatique. Venez apprendre avec nous!

 Vos fonctions 

La prise en charge du développement et de la validation continus de Secure nécessite des environnements de test d’intégration qui peuvent refléter la production, mettre à disposition des tests de contrainte et de charge, ou permettre des tests d’intégration nets et rapides des nouvelles fonctionnalités et capacités, à la fois au sein des groupes d’ingénierie contribuant à l’ensemble du produit et entre eux. Vous êtes passionné par la mise à disposition, la surveillance et la maintenance des infrastructures essentielles utilisées chaque jour pour le développement et les tests. En plus de veiller à un fonctionnement efficace, vous mettrez en place et en œuvre des processus et du code qui assurent que ce qui est opérationnel le reste.

 Vos atouts 

Vous êtes motivé et autonome, axé sur les résultats et impliqué. Vous êtes passionné par les opérations en nuage et vous aimez collaborer dans un environnement d’équipe. Vous avez du plaisir en apprenant de nouvelles technologies. Vous voulez aller au fond des choses, comprendre ce qu'il se passe et obtenir un résultat. Vous n'abandonnez pas face à des problèmes complexes.

 Atouts 
 2 à 5 ans d’expérience sur des serveurs Linux  Capacité à s'adapter rapidement aux nouvelles fonctionnalités et aux nouveaux logiciels  Expérience avec le débogage des réseaux  Expérience dans un environnement infonuagique avec divers composants  Expérience dans les systèmes distribués  Expérience de débogage des problèmes de performance au niveau de l’application  Expérience dans le déploiement et la surveillance automatisés de type DevOps  Pourquoi travailler chez Cisco? 

#NoussommesCisco signifie que chaque personne est unique, mais qu’elle met son talent au service de l’équipe afin d’apporter sa contribution et d’œuvrer en faveur d’un avenir inclusif pour tous.

Nous adhérons aux technologies numériques et aidons nos clients à mettre en œuvre des changements dans leurs entreprises numériques. Certains nous pensent peut-être « vieux » (36 ans de réussites!) et axés seulement sur le matériel, mais nous sommes également une entreprise de logiciels Et une entreprise axée sur la sécurité. Nous avons même inventé un réseau intuitif qui s’adapte, prédit, apprend et protège. Aucune autre entreprise ne peut faire ce que nous faisons; nous ne pouvons pas être enfermés dans une seule case!

L’expression « transformation numérique » sert à attirer l’attention, mais elle est plutôt vide de sens si elle ne s’accompagne pas d’une culture qui autorise l’innovation, la créativité et, oui, même l’échec (si cela permet d’apprendre).

Au quotidien, nous nous concentrons sur l’offre et la demande. Nous donnons le meilleur de nous-mêmes, nous mettons notre ego de côté, et nous mettons du cœur au travail (cela fait partie de notre ADN). Nous prenons nos responsabilités, nous prenons des mesures audacieuses, et nous savons apprécier la différence. Parce que sans diversité de pensée et sans engagement pour l’égalité entre tous, il n’y a pas de progrès.

Our team
Aha! engineering is a mid-sized, fully remote team that is highly productive. We are centered around North American time zones so we can collaborate during the workday.
We help each other grow: We each bring unique skills to the table and want our teammates to feel valued from the start. Our onboarding program exposes new hires to the codebase and lets them contribute right away. We move quickly: We ship code multiple times a day. We believe in getting valuable features in front of customers and iteratively improving as we learn what works and what does not. We value product over process: We want the team to have the time and focus on solving complex challenges. We minimize the overhead by setting clear goals and avoiding heavyweight processes and excessive meetings.We share knowledge freely: We share our learnings with each other and with the developer community. Our engineering blog demonstrates how we tackle interesting challenges at Aha! We enjoy: We like what we do. And we want you to love your team and your job too. Learn more about The Responsive Method , our company values , and the generous benefits we offer.Our technology
Our web application is a single-instance, multi-tenant Ruby on Rails monolith supported by Postgres (database), Redis (background jobs), and memcached (Rails caching). We also run a Node.js webserver to support collaborative editing and real-time updates. Our application is hosted on Amazon Web Services and architected with ECS for reproducibility and scalability.
We utilize a growing amount of React on the front end to build rich client-side experiences, including our fully collaborative text editor and our slide presentation editor. We balance the strengths of both technologies — Rails for its conventions and simplicity and React for more powerful interactive functionality.
We embrace new technologies that help us deliver a lovable product, but we also remain cognizant of the maintenance overhead that a new library or platform brings. We solve the problems in front of us rather than prematurely optimizing to address issues that may never materialize.
We do most of our planning and collaboration in Aha! Roadmaps and built Aha! Develop so that software engineers and their teams could take advantage of those same rich features. We use Slack and Zoom for video calls. (Email? Rarely.)
Your Experience
Most of our features involve writing significant Ruby on Rails code, so you should have experience working in a Rails codebase. We also write a lot of React but we are happy to help you learn that part on the job.
You Also Have The Below Experience And Skills
We believe that being a kind person who elevates the rest of the team is just as valuable as writing great code. You have strong problem-solving skills and experience working on important functionality for a cloud-based product. You are humble, eager to learn, and always willing to help others. You want teammates who enjoy solving problems regardless of the technologies and techniques involved. You have worked at meaningful scale before and want to do so again.
2+ years of experience working in Ruby on RailsExperience producing scalable, efficient, and maintainable codeExperience building features (ideally at a high-growth SaaS company)Active collaborator with product teamsYour work at Aha!

Our team
Aha! engineering is a mid-sized, fully remote team that is highly productive. We are centered around North American time zones so we can collaborate during the workday.
We help each other grow: We each bring unique skills to the table and want our teammates to feel valued from the start. Our onboarding program exposes new hires to the codebase and lets them contribute right away. We move quickly: We ship code multiple times a day. We believe in getting valuable features in front of customers and iteratively improving as we learn what works and what does not. We value product over process: We want the team to have the time and focus on solving complex challenges. We minimize the overhead by setting clear goals and avoiding heavyweight processes and excessive meetings.We share knowledge freely: We share our learnings with each other and with the developer community. Our engineering blog demonstrates how we tackle interesting challenges at Aha! We enjoy: We like what we do. And we want you to love your team and your job too. Learn more about The Responsive Method , our company values , and the generous benefits we offer.Our technology
Our web application is a single-instance, multi-tenant Ruby on Rails monolith supported by Postgres (database), Redis (background jobs), and memcached (Rails caching). We also run a Node.js webserver to support collaborative editing and real-time updates. Our application is hosted on Amazon Web Services and architected with ECS for reproducibility and scalability.
We utilize a growing amount of React on the front end to build rich client-side experiences, including our fully collaborative text editor and our slide presentation editor. We balance the strengths of both technologies — Rails for its conventions and simplicity and React for more powerful interactive functionality.
We embrace new technologies that help us deliver a lovable product, but we also remain cognizant of the maintenance overhead that a new library or platform brings. We solve the problems in front of us rather than prematurely optimizing to address issues that may never materialize.
We do most of our planning and collaboration in Aha! Roadmaps and built Aha! Develop so that software engineers and their teams could take advantage of those same rich features. We use Slack and Zoom for video calls. (Email? Rarely.)
Your Experience
Most of our features involve writing significant Ruby on Rails code, so you should have experience working in a Rails codebase. We also write a lot of React but we are happy to help you learn that part on the job.
You Also Have The Below Experience And Skills
We believe that being a kind person who elevates the rest of the team is just as valuable as writing great code. You have strong problem-solving skills and experience working on important functionality for a cloud-based product. You are humble, eager to learn, and always willing to help others. You want teammates who enjoy solving problems regardless of the technologies and techniques involved. You have worked at meaningful scale before and want to do so again.

Our team
Aha! engineering is a mid-sized, fully remote team that is highly productive. We are centered around North American time zones so we can collaborate during the workday.
We help each other grow: We each bring unique skills to the table and want our teammates to feel valued from the start. Our onboarding program exposes new hires to the codebase and lets them contribute right away. We move quickly: We ship code multiple times a day. We believe in getting valuable features in front of customers and iteratively improving as we learn what works and what does not. We value product over process: We want the team to have the time and focus on solving complex challenges. We minimize the overhead by setting clear goals and avoiding heavyweight processes and excessive meetings.We share knowledge freely: We share our learnings with each other and with the developer community.

Our web application is a single-instance, multi-tenant Ruby on Rails monolith supported by Postgres (database), Redis (background jobs), and memcached (Rails caching). We also run a Node.js webserver to support collaborative editing and real-time updates. Our application is hosted on Amazon Web Services and architected with ECS for reproducibility and scalability.
We utilize a growing amount of React on the front end to build rich client-side experiences, including our fully collaborative text editor and our slide presentation editor. We balance the strengths of both technologies — Rails for its conventions and simplicity and React for more powerful interactive functionality.
We embrace new technologies that help us deliver a lovable product, but we also remain cognizant of the maintenance overhead that a new library or platform brings. We solve the problems in front of us rather than prematurely optimizing to address issues that may never materialize.
We do most of our planning and collaboration in Aha! Roadmaps and built Aha! Develop so that software engineers and their teams could take advantage of those same rich features. We use Slack and Zoom for video calls. (Email? Rarely.)
Your Experience
Most of our features involve writing significant Ruby on Rails code, so you should have experience working in a Rails codebase. We also write a lot of React but we are happy to help you learn that part on the job.
You Also Have The Below Experience And Skills
We believe that being a kind person who elevates the rest of the team is just as valuable as writing great code. You have strong problem-solving skills and experience working on important functionality for a cloud-based product. You are humble, eager to learn, and always willing to help others. You want teammates who enjoy solving problems regardless of the technologies and techniques involved. You have worked at meaningful scale before and want to do so again.

Our team
Aha! engineering is a mid-sized, fully remote team that is highly productive. We are centered around North American time zones so we can collaborate during the workday.
We help each other grow: We each bring unique skills to the table and want our teammates to feel valued from the start. Our onboarding program exposes new hires to the codebase and lets them contribute right away. We move quickly: We ship code multiple times a day. We believe in getting valuable features in front of customers and iteratively improving as we learn what works and what does not. We value product over process: We want the team to have the time and focus on solving complex challenges. We minimize the overhead by setting clear goals and avoiding heavyweight processes and excessive meetings.We share knowledge freely: We share our learnings with each other and with the developer community. Our engineering blog demonstrates how we tackle interesting challenges at Aha! We enjoy: We like what we do. And we want you to love your team and your job too. Learn more about The Responsive Method , our company values , and the generous benefits we offer.Our technology
Our web application is a single-instance, multi-tenant Ruby on Rails monolith supported by Postgres (database), Redis (background jobs), and memcached (Rails caching). We also run a Node.js webserver to support collaborative editing and real-time updates. Our application is hosted on Amazon Web Services and architected with ECS for reproducibility and scalability.
We utilize a growing amount of React on the front end to build rich client-side experiences, including our fully collaborative text editor and our slide presentation editor. We balance the strengths of both technologies — Rails for its conventions and simplicity and React for more powerful interactive functionality.
We embrace new technologies that help us deliver a lovable product, but we also remain cognizant of the maintenance overhead that a new library or platform brings. We solve the problems in front of us rather than prematurely optimizing to address issues that may never materialize.
We do most of our planning and collaboration in Aha! Roadmaps and built Aha! Develop so that software engineers and their teams could take advantage of those same rich features. We use Slack and Zoom for video calls. (Email? Rarely.)
Your Experience
Most of our features involve writing significant Ruby on Rails code, so you should have experience working in a Rails codebase. We also write a lot of React but we are happy to help you learn that part on the job.
You Also Have The Below Experience And Skills
We believe that being a kind person who elevates the rest of the team is just as valuable as writing great code. You have strong problem-solving skills and experience working on important functionality for a cloud-based product. You are humble, eager to learn, and always willing to help others. You want teammates who enjoy solving problems regardless of the technologies and techniques involved. You have worked at meaningful scale before and want to do so again.
2+ years of experience working in Ruby on RailsExperience producing scalable, efficient, and maintainable codeExperience building features (ideally at a high-growth SaaS company)Active collaborator with product teamsYour work at Aha!
As a Ruby On Rails Engineer, Your Work Will Include

If this role sounds appealing, we would love to hear from you. (A real human reviews every application.)
Grow with us
Everyone deserves to reach their fullest potential. We know that when we do work that matters with people we care about in a high-growth environment, we feel engaged and alive. And our goal is to help you do just that. We offer all the benefits you would expect and more, including profit sharing.

Our team
Aha! engineering is a mid-sized, fully remote team that is highly productive. We are centered around North American time zones so we can collaborate during the workday.
We help each other grow: We each bring unique skills to the table and want our teammates to feel valued from the start. Our onboarding program exposes new hires to the codebase and lets them contribute right away. We move quickly: We ship code multiple times a day. We believe in getting valuable features in front of customers and iteratively improving as we learn what works and what does not. We value product over process: We want the team to have the time and focus on solving complex challenges. We minimize the overhead by setting clear goals and avoiding heavyweight processes and excessive meetings.We share knowledge freely: We share our learnings with each other and with the developer community. Our engineering blog demonstrates how we tackle interesting challenges at Aha! We enjoy: We like what we do. And we want you to love your team and your job too. Learn more about The Responsive Method , our company values , and the generous benefits we offer.Our technology
Our web application is a single-instance, multi-tenant Ruby on Rails monolith supported by Postgres (database), Redis (background jobs), and memcached (Rails caching). We also run a Node.js webserver to support collaborative editing and real-time updates. Our application is hosted on Amazon Web Services and architected with ECS for reproducibility and scalability.
We utilize a growing amount of React on the front end to build rich client-side experiences, including our fully collaborative text editor and our slide presentation editor. We balance the strengths of both technologies — Rails for its conventions and simplicity and React for more powerful interactive functionality.
We embrace new technologies that help us deliver a lovable product, but we also remain cognizant of the maintenance overhead that a new library or platform brings. We solve the problems in front of us rather than prematurely optimizing to address issues that may never materialize.
We do most of our planning and collaboration in Aha! Roadmaps and built Aha! Develop so that software engineers and their teams could take advantage of those same rich features. We use Slack and Zoom for video calls. (Email? Rarely.)
Your Experience
Most of our features involve writing significant Ruby on Rails code, so you should have experience working in a Rails codebase. We also write a lot of React but we are happy to help you learn that part on the job.
You Also Have The Below Experience And Skills
We believe that being a kind person who elevates the rest of the team is just as valuable as writing great code. You have strong problem-solving skills and experience working on important functionality for a cloud-based product. You are humble, eager to learn, and always willing to help others. You want teammates who enjoy solving problems regardless of the technologies and techniques involved. You have worked at meaningful scale before and want to do so again.

Freelance employees move between projects and could get onboarded 30 or more times in a single year.
 
And yet, much of the industry uses physical paperwork with no easy way to track payments, often struggling with compliance (due to ever-changing laws and union rules), and has few automation processes in place when it comes time to send payroll reports to their accountants.  

Wrapbook is an intuitive payroll and insurance solution for those balancing multiple projects. With digital solutions, simplified compliance, and comprehensive reporting, we take the stress away so employers and project-based workers can focus on the big picture. 

Commercial producers, filmmakers, and anyone creating media deserve robust solutions to meet their unique demands. 

With Wrapbook, you only have to ask for documents from cast and crew once. Our platform lets you move all the onboarding forms associated with any crew from a project to any future ones, giving you back hours. By swapping out paper timecards with digital ones, approving payroll is now a piece of cake. Crew can log into Wrapbook from any device to enter their hours and expenses. 

Providing producers with the right tools to onboard crew and process payments helps them put routine work on auto-pilot. That way, they can focus on more compelling tasks.

Our team
Aha! engineering is a mid-sized, fully remote team that is highly productive. We are centered around North American time zones so we can collaborate during the workday.
We help each other grow: We each bring unique skills to the table and want our teammates to feel valued from the start. Our onboarding program exposes new hires to the codebase and lets them contribute right away. We move quickly: We ship code multiple times a day. We believe in getting valuable features in front of customers and iteratively improving as we learn what works and what does not. We value product over process: We want the team to have the time and focus on solving complex challenges. We minimize the overhead by setting clear goals and avoiding heavyweight processes and excessive meetings.We share knowledge freely: We share our learnings with each other and with the developer community. Our engineering blog demonstrates how we tackle interesting challenges at Aha! We enjoy: We like what we do. And we want you to love your team and your job too. Learn more about The Responsive Method , our company values , and the generous benefits we offer.Our technology
Our web application is a single-instance, multi-tenant Ruby on Rails monolith supported by Postgres (database), Redis (background jobs), and memcached (Rails caching). We also run a Node.js webserver to support collaborative editing and real-time updates. Our application is hosted on Amazon Web Services and architected with ECS for reproducibility and scalability.
We utilize a growing amount of React on the front end to build rich client-side experiences, including our fully collaborative text editor and our slide presentation editor. We balance the strengths of both technologies — Rails for its conventions and simplicity and React for more powerful interactive functionality.
We embrace new technologies that help us deliver a lovable product, but we also remain cognizant of the maintenance overhead that a new library or platform brings. We solve the problems in front of us rather than prematurely optimizing to address issues that may never materialize.
We do most of our planning and collaboration in Aha! Roadmaps and built Aha! Develop so that software engineers and their teams could take advantage of those same rich features. We use Slack and Zoom for video calls. (Email? Rarely.)
Your Experience
Most of our features involve writing significant Ruby on Rails code, so you should have experience working in a Rails codebase. We also write a lot of React but we are happy to help you learn that part on the job.
You Also Have The Below Experience And Skills
We believe that being a kind person who elevates the rest of the team is just as valuable as writing great code. You have strong problem-solving skills and experience working on important functionality for a cloud-based product. You are humble, eager to learn, and always willing to help others. You want teammates who enjoy solving problems regardless of the technologies and techniques involved. You have worked at meaningful scale before and want to do so again.
2+ years of experience working in Ruby on RailsExperience producing scalable, efficient, and maintainable codeExperience building features (ideally at a high-growth SaaS company)Active collaborator with product teamsYour work at Aha!

If this role sounds appealing, we would love to hear from you. (A real human reviews every application.)

Everyone deserves to reach their fullest potential. We know that when we do work that matters with people we care about in a high-growth environment, we feel engaged and alive. And our goal is to help you do just that. We offer all the benefits you would expect and more, including profit sharing.

We’re looking for developers who are happy optimizing an index, poking a message queue and shifting everything left by 4 pixels. Having the confidence to jump projects and write some low-level network code too is a plus. The team is a group of dedicated individuals who utilize cryptographic algorithms and integrate them into internet protocols – you might be mentoring us with your skills at dealing with web-scale data. Team members are responsible for implementation and testing, with a heavy emphasis on security, efficiency, resiliency, and high performance. Our implementations are for a variety of desktop, mobile and embedded platforms.
Responsibilities

Skills & Qualifications
MUST HAVE's:
 Have a degree in Computer Engineering, Computer Science, Electrical Engineering, Mathematics or no degree with strong full-stack experience (javascript preferred). 75-90% back-end work in this role. 3+ years experience with SQL databases is key, but they really want developers who aren’t afraid to conquer and suggest new languages or technologies if a problem elsewhere pops up. They're currently using Postgres so that one would be ideal for quicker familiarity with their current codebase, but as long as they’re reasonably experienced with any of the major ones, e.g. MariaDB, SQL Server or Oracle (possibly even DB/2, but that one’s rare), jumping to another should not be a huge hurdle. Have they worked with the database directly rather than through a framework. Writing Queries by hand 3+ years experience with Node.JS in an Enterprise setting Ability to dissect a problem and form solutions that meet real-time constraints, especially when faced with enterprise-scale datasets.
NICE TO HAVE's
 Experience with Docker is a plus. Experience with React is a plus (it would give the person insight of how the back-end works) Experience with cryptography is a plus. Big data platforms (tools: Apache Hudi or Google’s BigQuery)

Our team
Aha! engineering is a mid-sized, fully remote team that is highly productive. We are centered around North American time zones so we can collaborate during the workday.
We help each other grow: We each bring unique skills to the table and want our teammates to feel valued from the start. Our onboarding program exposes new hires to the codebase and lets them contribute right away. We move quickly: We ship code multiple times a day. We believe in getting valuable features in front of customers and iteratively improving as we learn what works and what does not. We value product over process: We want the team to have the time and focus on solving complex challenges. We minimize the overhead by setting clear goals and avoiding heavyweight processes and excessive meetings.We share knowledge freely: We share our learnings with each other and with the developer community. Our engineering blog demonstrates how we tackle interesting challenges at Aha! We enjoy: We like what we do. And we want you to love your team and your job too. Learn more about The Responsive Method , our company values , and the generous benefits we offer.Our technology
Our web application is a single-instance, multi-tenant Ruby on Rails monolith supported by Postgres (database), Redis (background jobs), and memcached (Rails caching). We also run a Node.js webserver to support collaborative editing and real-time updates. Our application is hosted on Amazon Web Services and architected with ECS for reproducibility and scalability.
We utilize a growing amount of React on the front end to build rich client-side experiences, including our fully collaborative text editor and our slide presentation editor. We balance the strengths of both technologies — Rails for its conventions and simplicity and React for more powerful interactive functionality.
We embrace new technologies that help us deliver a lovable product, but we also remain cognizant of the maintenance overhead that a new library or platform brings. We solve the problems in front of us rather than prematurely optimizing to address issues that may never materialize.
We do most of our planning and collaboration in Aha! Roadmaps and built Aha! Develop so that software engineers and their teams could take advantage of those same rich features. We use Slack and Zoom for video calls. (Email? Rarely.)
Your Experience
Most of our features involve writing significant Ruby on Rails code, so you should have experience working in a Rails codebase. We also write a lot of React but we are happy to help you learn that part on the job.
You Also Have The Below Experience And Skills
We believe that being a kind person who elevates the rest of the team is just as valuable as writing great code. You have strong problem-solving skills and experience working on important functionality for a cloud-based product. You are humble, eager to learn, and always willing to help others. You want teammates who enjoy solving problems regardless of the technologies and techniques involved. You have worked at meaningful scale before and want to do so again.

Our team
Aha! engineering is a mid-sized, fully remote team that is highly productive. We are centered around North American time zones so we can collaborate during the workday.
We help each other grow: We each bring unique skills to the table and want our teammates to feel valued from the start. Our onboarding program exposes new hires to the codebase and lets them contribute right away. We move quickly: We ship code multiple times a day. We believe in getting valuable features in front of customers and iteratively improving as we learn what works and what does not. We value product over process: We want the team to have the time and focus on solving complex challenges. We minimize the overhead by setting clear goals and avoiding heavyweight processes and excessive meetings.We share knowledge freely: We share our learnings with each other and with the developer community. Our engineering blog demonstrates how we tackle interesting challenges at Aha! We enjoy: We like what we do. And we want you to love your team and your job too. Learn more about The Responsive Method , our company values , and the generous benefits we offer.Our technology
Our web application is a single-instance, multi-tenant Ruby on Rails monolith supported by Postgres (database), Redis (background jobs), and memcached (Rails caching). We also run a Node.js webserver to support collaborative editing and real-time updates. Our application is hosted on Amazon Web Services and architected with ECS for reproducibility and scalability.
We utilize a growing amount of React on the front end to build rich client-side experiences, including our fully collaborative text editor and our slide presentation editor. We balance the strengths of both technologies — Rails for its conventions and simplicity and React for more powerful interactive functionality.
We embrace new technologies that help us deliver a lovable product, but we also remain cognizant of the maintenance overhead that a new library or platform brings. We solve the problems in front of us rather than prematurely optimizing to address issues that may never materialize.
We do most of our planning and collaboration in Aha! Roadmaps and built Aha! Develop so that software engineers and their teams could take advantage of those same rich features. We use Slack and Zoom for video calls. (Email? Rarely.)
Your Experience
Most of our features involve writing significant Ruby on Rails code, so you should have experience working in a Rails codebase. We also write a lot of React but we are happy to help you learn that part on the job.
You Also Have The Below Experience And Skills
We believe that being a kind person who elevates the rest of the team is just as valuable as writing great code. You have strong problem-solving skills and experience working on important functionality for a cloud-based product. You are humble, eager to learn, and always willing to help others. You want teammates who enjoy solving problems regardless of the technologies and techniques involved. You have worked at meaningful scale before and want to do so again.
