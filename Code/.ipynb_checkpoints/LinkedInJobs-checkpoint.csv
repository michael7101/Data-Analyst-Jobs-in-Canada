About Capital One Canada

We've been helping millions of Canadians for over 20 years by providing them with access to credit. We're on a journey to put our customers first, and keep them there, by providing innovative, smart solutions that make banking effortless.

Working with us

How do we do things at Capital One? We listen — to our people, and to our customers. We change with the times, currently working remotely with plans to move to a flexible hybrid model  (remote and/or in-office) in the future. A flexible hybrid working model is one that creates the opportunity to match the work that we do to the environment that best supports that work. We recognize that everyone has a unique working pattern so we’re open to discussing flexible working arrangements that will best accommodate you.

At Capital One, data is at the center of everything we do. When we launched as a startup we disrupted the credit card industry by individually personalizing every credit card offer using statistical modeling and the relational database, cutting edge technology in 1988! Fast-forward a few years, and this little innovation and our passion for data has skyrocketed us to a Fortune 200 company and a leader in the world of data-driven decision-making. As a Data Analyst at Capital One, you’ll be part of a team that’s leading the next wave of disruption at a whole new scale, using the latest in distributed computing technologies and operating across billions and billions of customer transactions to unlock the big opportunities that help everyday people save money, time, and agony in their financial lives.

On any given day, you could be:
 Writing SQL to clean, transform, investigate data.  Working closely with business partners to harness the power of data in compliance testing.  Designing rich data visualizations to communicate complex ideas.  Ensure data and intent integrity by automated data quality verification pipelines.

Creative: Big, undefined problems and petabytes of data don’t frighten you. You’re used to working with abstract data, and you love discovering new narratives in un-mined territories.  Proactive: You will want to share your knowledge with your peers and contribute back to inner/open source projects which you might consume. 

The Basics…What We Need from You!

Our clients offer top-tier pay for top-tier talent. We're recruiting this role for our client, Trilogy. Have you got what it takes?
We do not believe in hiring consultants. Imagine taking your car to the repair shop for a fix, and they only have a consulting mechanic who recommends that you replace your carburetor. Who is going to do that? When we have problems with our business, we value people who can fix them and not just make pitch decks and general recommendations.
Trilogy has an ever-growing portfolio of 80+ software products spanning multiple industries and geographies. We have different business units that own these products, and Trilogy hosts business-critical functions such as finance, customer support, and hiring for all these business units. In this role, you will work with the senior stakeholders across the business units and functions to help solve the problems they face. For instance, you may work with the SVP of Finance to hire qualified accountants in one week and work with the CIO to evaluate M&A targets using a scalable model the following week.
We are looking for exceptional problem solvers and brilliant thinkers to join our team. Unlike other companies, we do not judge you by arbitrary stamps, such as whether you graduated from X university or worked in a 'top' consulting firm. We want problem solvers who enjoy taking on the challenge of solving complex problems, dive deep to find the root causes of these issues, and propose and implement fixes that solve them.
If you are interested in solving complex problems while gaining unparalleled experience working across business functions and units, apply today!
What You Will Be Doing
Conduct research and analysis to find creative solutions for issues with real business impact.Execute assignments aiming to improve the efficiency of different functions, such as Operations, Hiring, M&A, and more.
What You Won’t Be Doing
Provide high-level insights and recommendations - we want implementers, not consultants.Develop theoretical scenarios and try to sell potential insights to management - you will work on real business problems with real solutions.
Data Analyst Key Responsibilities
Solve the most complex issues facing the organization.
Basic Requirements
Bachelor’s degree in a quantitative field (e.g., Economics, Finance, Mathematics, Engineering).5+ years of work experience.Interest in solving real-world problems across a broad range of functions.

Our clients offer top-tier pay for top-tier talent. We're recruiting this role for our client, Trilogy. Have you got what it takes?
We do not believe in hiring consultants. Imagine taking your car to the repair shop for a fix, and they only have a consulting mechanic who recommends that you replace your carburetor. Who is going to do that? When we have problems with our business, we value people who can fix them and not just make pitch decks and general recommendations.
Trilogy has an ever-growing portfolio of 80+ software products spanning multiple industries and geographies. We have different business units that own these products, and Trilogy hosts business-critical functions such as finance, customer support, and hiring for all these business units. In this role, you will work with the senior stakeholders across the business units and functions to help solve the problems they face. For instance, you may work with the SVP of Finance to hire qualified accountants in one week and work with the CIO to evaluate M&A targets using a scalable model the following week.
We are looking for exceptional problem solvers and brilliant thinkers to join our team. Unlike other companies, we do not judge you by arbitrary stamps, such as whether you graduated from X university or worked in a 'top' consulting firm. We want problem solvers who enjoy taking on the challenge of solving complex problems, dive deep to find the root causes of these issues, and propose and implement fixes that solve them.
If you are interested in solving complex problems while gaining unparalleled experience working across business functions and units, apply today!
What You Will Be Doing
Conduct research and analysis to find creative solutions for issues with real business impact.Execute assignments aiming to improve the efficiency of different functions, such as Operations, Hiring, M&A, and more.
What You Won’t Be Doing
Provide high-level insights and recommendations - we want implementers, not consultants.Develop theoretical scenarios and try to sell potential insights to management - you will work on real business problems with real solutions.
Data Analyst Key Responsibilities
Solve the most complex issues facing the organization.
Basic Requirements
Bachelor’s degree in a quantitative field (e.g., Economics, Finance, Mathematics, Engineering).5+ years of work experience.Interest in solving real-world problems across a broad range of functions.

Our clients offer top-tier pay for top-tier talent. We're recruiting this role for our client, Trilogy. Have you got what it takes?
We do not believe in hiring consultants. Imagine taking your car to the repair shop for a fix, and they only have a consulting mechanic who recommends that you replace your carburetor. Who is going to do that? When we have problems with our business, we value people who can fix them and not just make pitch decks and general recommendations.
Trilogy has an ever-growing portfolio of 80+ software products spanning multiple industries and geographies. We have different business units that own these products, and Trilogy hosts business-critical functions such as finance, customer support, and hiring for all these business units. In this role, you will work with the senior stakeholders across the business units and functions to help solve the problems they face. For instance, you may work with the SVP of Finance to hire qualified accountants in one week and work with the CIO to evaluate M&A targets using a scalable model the following week.
We are looking for exceptional problem solvers and brilliant thinkers to join our team. Unlike other companies, we do not judge you by arbitrary stamps, such as whether you graduated from X university or worked in a 'top' consulting firm. We want problem solvers who enjoy taking on the challenge of solving complex problems, dive deep to find the root causes of these issues, and propose and implement fixes that solve them.
If you are interested in solving complex problems while gaining unparalleled experience working across business functions and units, apply today!
What You Will Be Doing
Conduct research and analysis to find creative solutions for issues with real business impact.Execute assignments aiming to improve the efficiency of different functions, such as Operations, Hiring, M&A, and more.

Data Analyst Key Responsibilities
Solve the most complex issues facing the organization.
Basic Requirements
Bachelor’s degree in a quantitative field (e.g., Economics, Finance, Mathematics, Engineering).5+ years of work experience.Interest in solving real-world problems across a broad range of functions.

We do not believe in hiring consultants. Imagine taking your car to the repair shop for a fix, and they only have a consulting mechanic who recommends that you replace your carburetor. Who is going to do that? When we have problems with our business, we value people who can fix them and not just make pitch decks and general recommendations.
Trilogy has an ever-growing portfolio of 80+ software products spanning multiple industries and geographies. We have different business units that own these products, and Trilogy hosts business-critical functions such as finance, customer support, and hiring for all these business units.

More About Hopper

Despite the pandemic’s impact on the travel industry, Hopper has emerged stronger than ever. As the travel industry continues to rebound, Hopper has demonstrated significant outperformance with its category-leading mobile-only marketplace, delivering value to customers and supply partners with the company’s proprietary suite of fintech offerings.

Here are just a few stats that demonstrate the company’s recent growth:
 Hopper’s valuation is now over $5B, which is more than triple our valuation from early 2020. The company grew its revenue by more than 300% YoY in 2021. Hopper’s monthly revenues are now 375% higher than its pre-pandemic high point and Hopper Cloud, Hopper’s new B2B initiative, is already 15% of its revenues and growing. According to Apptopia, Hopper was the #1 most downloaded OTA in the US in 2021. The app has over 70 million downloads. Hopper’s recovery is faster than the market and its share of the air travel market in North America is now 300% higher than prior to the pandemic, according to MIDT. We are now the 3rd largest air travel agency in North America. The company sells over $2B in travel and travel related financial services annually. Hopper’s fintech offerings, such as Price Freeze and Rebooking Guarantee, now represent over 70% of its air revenue. Given the success of its travel fintech, Hopper recently launched a B2B initiative called Hopper Cloud, where any travel provider can unlock a totally unique revenue stream by seamlessly integrating and offering Hopper’s travel content and fintech products. Hopper Cloud partners include Capital One, Kayak, Marriott, Amadeus, Trip.com, and MakeMyTrip.
The industry opportunity for Hopper Cloud is enormous as projections estimate that if all travel distribution channels offered travel fintech, it could increase the total consumer spend for the sector by $200 billion annually.

And all this recent growth is just the beginning.

More About Hopper

Despite the pandemic’s impact on the travel industry, Hopper has emerged stronger than ever. As the travel industry continues to rebound, Hopper has demonstrated significant outperformance with its category-leading mobile-only marketplace, delivering value to customers and supply partners with the company’s proprietary suite of fintech offerings.

Here are just a few stats that demonstrate the company’s recent growth:
 Hopper’s valuation is now over $5B, which is more than triple our valuation from early 2020. The company grew its revenue by more than 300% YoY in 2021. Hopper’s monthly revenues are now 375% higher than its pre-pandemic high point and Hopper Cloud, Hopper’s new B2B initiative, is already 15% of its revenues and growing. According to Apptopia, Hopper was the #1 most downloaded OTA in the US in 2021. The app has over 70 million downloads. Hopper’s recovery is faster than the market and its share of the air travel market in North America is now 300% higher than prior to the pandemic, according to MIDT. We are now the 3rd largest air travel agency in North America. The company sells over $2B in travel and travel related financial services annually. Hopper’s fintech offerings, such as Price Freeze and Rebooking Guarantee, now represent over 70% of its air revenue. Given the success of its travel fintech, Hopper recently launched a B2B initiative called Hopper Cloud, where any travel provider can unlock a totally unique revenue stream by seamlessly integrating and offering Hopper’s travel content and fintech products. Hopper Cloud partners include Capital One, Kayak, Marriott, Amadeus, Trip.com, and MakeMyTrip.
The industry opportunity for Hopper Cloud is enormous as projections estimate that if all travel distribution channels offered travel fintech, it could increase the total consumer spend for the sector by $200 billion annually.
