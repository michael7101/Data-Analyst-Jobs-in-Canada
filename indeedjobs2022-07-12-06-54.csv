As customers ourselves, are we not delighted each time we have a pleasant experience interacting with a customer service department? Can you remember the best experience you had when in need of assistance? Did it influence how you felt about the company? Chances are, it did.
 At Coveo, our Technical Support team is on a mission to transform every situation into an enriching experience, one interaction at a time, so that Coveo employees, partners and customers can strive towards their desired outcomes. If this resonates with you, please read on.
 The mission
 Coveo Support is not your typical call center image that you might imagine when you think of support. We are not siloed into tiers (levels) of support. We are a team of specialists with great business and technical knowledge of the Coveo Relevance Cloud Platform . The Program Manager - Business Intelligence's mission is to oversee and manage the team's business intelligence program and ensure that we deliver world class service:

Work in collaboration with the management team to establish short, medium and long term strategy in terms of business intelligence.
Build reports and dashboards, for the Support Delivery team.
Identify trends, correlations and causations in Support data to optimize operations and overall customer experience.
Collaborate cross functionally with internal teams on business intelligence initiatives.

To do so, you will work with a team of professionals to ensure continuous improvements in employee engagement, internal collaboration and customer satisfaction.
 Sounds interesting? This is what it looks like on a daily basis!
 Once you are all settled in to start off the day (whatever that means for you: coffee, side chat with colleagues, etc.), here's what you'll be doing:

Meet with the rest of Coveo Technical Support leadership to identify strategic initiatives
Analyze data from various sources (operations, platform usage, CSAT) to identify overarching trends in service and customer experience and identify areas for improvement
Collaborate with the corporate Business Intelligence team on data architecture and requirements for the business unit
Work with the Technical Support Enablement team to understand improvement opportunities and how to best measure their impacts on operations and customer experience
Share findings with the Support leadership team to help shape and improve customer service and support delivery

A passionate strategist and overseer
 Coveo is a very fast-paced and dynamic company, meaning its management teams need to be ready to focus on building and improving team processes and dynamics, rather than maintaining them. This entails an ability to think of things at a high level and with a broad vision. This makes for an environment rich in challenge and stimulation and where one needs to have the flexibility to pivot quickly. Proven business intelligence experience in customer service and technical support departments is a definite plus, but the following will speak for you.

You have a strong interest in top edge technologies, especially proficient in SQL and dbt
You are no stranger to Snowflake.
You are qualified with Business Intelligence software / data visualization tools
You have experience building and maintaining data pipelines (we use AWS)
You are at ease interacting with business stakeholders internally and understand the business processes.
You have a strong understanding of Support/Customer Service processes
You have a solid understanding of Salesforce and its data model
You are a true believer in delivering enriching experiences
You are organized
Finally, you strive working in a fast paced environment, believe in teamwork and collaboration, and are strategically-minded

We have a fit?

As customers ourselves, are we not delighted each time we have a pleasant experience interacting with a customer service department? Can you remember the best experience you had when in need of assistance? Did it influence how you felt about the company? Chances are, it did.
 At Coveo, our Technical Support team is on a mission to transform every situation into an enriching experience, one interaction at a time, so that Coveo employees, partners and customers can strive towards their desired outcomes. If this resonates with you, please read on.
 The mission
 Coveo Support is not your typical call center image that you might imagine when you think of support. We are not siloed into tiers (levels) of support. We are a team of specialists with great business and technical knowledge of the Coveo Relevance Cloud Platform . The Program Manager - Business Intelligence's mission is to oversee and manage the team's business intelligence program and ensure that we deliver world class service:

Work in collaboration with the management team to establish short, medium and long term strategy in terms of business intelligence.
Build reports and dashboards, for the Support Delivery team.
Identify trends, correlations and causations in Support data to optimize operations and overall customer experience.
Collaborate cross functionally with internal teams on business intelligence initiatives.

To do so, you will work with a team of professionals to ensure continuous improvements in employee engagement, internal collaboration and customer satisfaction.
 Sounds interesting? This is what it looks like on a daily basis!
 Once you are all settled in to start off the day (whatever that means for you: coffee, side chat with colleagues, etc.), here's what you'll be doing:

Meet with the rest of Coveo Technical Support leadership to identify strategic initiatives
Analyze data from various sources (operations, platform usage, CSAT) to identify overarching trends in service and customer experience and identify areas for improvement
Collaborate with the corporate Business Intelligence team on data architecture and requirements for the business unit
Work with the Technical Support Enablement team to understand improvement opportunities and how to best measure their impacts on operations and customer experience
Share findings with the Support leadership team to help shape and improve customer service and support delivery

A passionate strategist and overseer
 Coveo is a very fast-paced and dynamic company, meaning its management teams need to be ready to focus on building and improving team processes and dynamics, rather than maintaining them. This entails an ability to think of things at a high level and with a broad vision. This makes for an environment rich in challenge and stimulation and where one needs to have the flexibility to pivot quickly. Proven business intelligence experience in customer service and technical support departments is a definite plus, but the following will speak for you.

You have a strong interest in top edge technologies, especially proficient in SQL and dbt
You are no stranger to Snowflake.
You are qualified with Business Intelligence software / data visualization tools
You have experience building and maintaining data pipelines (we use AWS)
You are at ease interacting with business stakeholders internally and understand the business processes.
You have a strong understanding of Support/Customer Service processes
You have a solid understanding of Salesforce and its data model
You are a true believer in delivering enriching experiences
You are organized
Finally, you strive working in a fast paced environment, believe in teamwork and collaboration, and are strategically-minded

Check us out in Medium, Betakit, Financial Post, Perkins + Will, our Instagram, and our Blog.
 We acknowledge that Bench headquarters is located on the traditional, ancestral, and unceded territory of the Coast Salish Peoples, including the territories of the xʷməθkwəy̓əm (Musqueam), Skwxwú7mesh (Squamish), and Səl̓ílwətaʔ/Selilwitulh (Tsleil-Waututh) Nations.
 Businesses need to understand their financial performance, but for many smaller ones, this means a trade-off between managing their books and running their businesses.
 Our mission is to make a profound difference in the quality of life of one million people. From creatives to chiropractors, Bench helps thousands of small business owners and entrepreneurs master their financial lives. Because understanding your finances should be three things: simple, effortless, and affordable.
 We're growing fast, and we're looking for exceptional people to join us on this incredible journey. Check out our culture guide to learn more about what it's like to work at Bench and read more about our business here!
 To make a difference for a million people, we need to significantly increase our ability to scale. The data we collect in our product is the key to this scale. It can help us understand everything from which financial institutions are the more reliable data sources, to what activities are taking up a disproportionate amount of bookkeeping time, to which UX patterns are most effective for our customers.
 We're looking for a Product Analyst to join our Product team and fall in love with our data—warts and all. We believe that having someone in this role will supercharge both our product investment decision making and also the way we build features. This person will need to deeply understand data derived from browser analytics (Google Analytics, Heap), data imported from financial institutions (custom integrations, Plaid integrations, and also an in-house data processing team), and the incredibly interesting data associated with our in-house (250 person) bookkeeping team, who together handle 12,000 years worth of books each year (and growing!).
 What you'll be getting up to:

Work with executive leadership on product strategy and identify key areas of investment.
Help quantify, validate, and measure the hypotheses put forward by Product Managers.
Work closely with the engineering and the roll-out team to ensure that new features are set up to be measurable
Build dashboards and other means of understanding the data we ingest through our application
Codify metrics that measure the success of our launches and communicate them effectively to stakeholders.

To be successful in this role, you'll need to have:

A resonance with our mission and principles.
An activated curiosity and openness to being an equitable and inclusive team-member. Our commitment to anti-racism and anti-discrimination as a company excites you.
A demonstrable ability of data analysis
A strong SQL toolkit
Experience working with AWS Redshift or similar technology
A demonstrable drive to grow. Fostering growth is what we do here, in ourselves and in our reports. Our mission is big, and we all need to grow significantly to achieve it.
Excellent communication and stakeholder management skills, a keen perceptiveness to your audience, and the ability to authentically generate buy-in across multiple teams.

Perks of working here:

At Bench we share information freely and openly whenever possible. The salary range for this full-time permanent role is $72,720 - $90,200. Stock options will also be a part of the total compensation package.
In addition, we offer an extended benefits package that includes paid vacation, unlimited paid flex days, stock options, and full health, dental, and vision.
You'll get unlimited access to Inkblot Therapy, our virtual counselling service to support mental wellbeing, and Bravely, our confidential, on-demand, 1:1 professional coaching service.
Bench has a number of Affinity Groups - groups of people who have shared identities and experiences! The purpose of these groups is to support underrepresented Benchmates and amplify their voices.
Bench is moving towards being a fully remote organization, with a couple of team exceptions, and we're in the process of closing our Vancouver HQ. We focus our hiring efforts in the following provinces: British Columbia, Alberta, Ontario, New Brunswick, and Nova Scotia.
You'll have access to our Home Office Setup Fund, to ensure that you have everything you need to work comfortably from home, from day one.

Everyone has their own unique talents. Even if you don't meet 100% of the qualifications outlined above, tell us why you'd be a great fit for this role in your application.
 We believe that unchecked biases disproportionately impact the most marginalized people in society—including but not limited to BIPOC, LGBTQ2S+ people, immigrants, and people with disabilities. We strongly encourage applications from people with these identities or other marginalized communities because we believe that without you, we are all less. At Bench, we don't stand for tokenism.
