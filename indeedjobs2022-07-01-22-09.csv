 Canadian North is an equal opportunity employer. Members of designated groups (Inuit, First Nations, Métis, Women, Visible Minorities, and People with Disabilities) are encouraged to apply and self-identify.
 About Us
 Canadian North is 100% Inuit-owned by Makivik Corporation and the Inuvialuit Development Group. We serve an incredibly small and widely dispersed customer base, which represents less than 1% of the population in Canada. Our flights enable the movement of people, food, and medicine, while providing access to crucial medical care and government services.
 Nearly all of the communities we serve have no road or rail access, meaning the residents are completely dependent on air service for all aspects of life. We are uniquely equipped to meet this challenge head on with our diverse fleet of aircrafts capable of serving in varied environments from snow to ice to gravel.
 One-third of the Canadian North team live and work in the Arctic with around 200 Inuit contributing to all areas of our organization, including as board members and senior leadership.
 Our mission is to meaningfully improve the lives of our people, our customers, and the communities we serve. Our vision is to be respected within Canada’s North as a dynamic and caring airline, diversifying to serve other geographies and markets by leveraging our skills and resources.

As part of EA Create, we search the globe for trusted and talented external partners to work with EA Studio game teams and central technology teams. We are a central team that owns EA’s due diligence evaluation process and risk management process. We support multiple disciplines, including co-dev, porting, art, animation, cinematics, UX-UI, engineering, and audio.
Key Responsibilities:

Partner evaluations and due diligence reporting using XDI’s risk management framework.
Supporting strategic partner portfolio management including regular check-ins and on-site assessments with established partners to ensure ongoing trust and viability.

Early morning or evening calls and travel (when possible) are a reality for this role as we interface with global partners and teams. That said, our team is encouraged to strive for work life balance and to proactively manage capacity in a way that supports this goal.
Candidates with a strong preference for an in-person team dynamic may not thrive in this role as much communication and collaboration is now done remotely.
Our team members know that our team doesn’t start and stop with XDI. It’s important to expand our network (both within EA and externally).
Our team members are self-directed with an ability to quickly surface the right information at the right time to those who need it.

You will share critical knowledge about our partners with XDI, other Business Development groups, and teams across the company to ensure those working with our partners access the information they need to make key decisions.

Experience & Capabilities:

Our team strikes a fine balance between advocacy for our partners, both internal and external, and conducting risk evaluations to ensure EA’s IP is protected. Candidates have to be able to do both.
Ability to think and act globally. We interact with EA teams and external partners from all over the globe. We expect our team members to conduct themselves with high integrity and embrace cultural differences, value diverse opinions, and do their part to promote an inclusive development environment.
Demonstrated business acumen: this role requires objective decision making, and excellent collaboration ability with diverse teams and partners.
Lifelong learner who is inquisitive and enjoys knowledge acquisition as much as knowledge sharing. Should have a degree of comfort with public speaking, delivering presentations/panels, and facilitating brainstorming sessions.
Game development experience is highly desirable.
Experience in centralized departments such as studio operations, publishing, licensing, program management, business development are highly transferable for this role.
You will be expected to travel on-site to visit your partners on occasion and while often you will travel with other XDI team members or EA game team members there are times you will be asked to travel alone. Must have a degree of comfort with business travel and everything that comes with it (expense reports, airports, time zone changes, etc). On average, XDI team members do one international trip (1 week+/- duration) and 2-3 short domestic trips a quarter.
