How do I Apply?
For students, we believe evaluating you through relationships over resumes, and are focused on learning about who you are and what you’re interested in to uncover your true potential. In short, we don’t believe resumes will provide us with an accurate depiction of what you’re truly about in order to properly assess your potential. Instead we want to get to know YOU and hear about the experiences that have shaped you. We know… this might sound crazy but we do not want you to submit your resume instead we ask that as part of your application, you complete the below:
1) Complete your PLUM Profile here
2) Save your PLUM Profile as PDF. Click here to learn how
3) Complete a very short one-way video interview by clicking here (if you have already done this, you don't need to do it again)
4) When it prompts you to submit your resume, do not attach your resume! Instead, attach your most recent transcript and your PLUM profile in one PDF under the ""resume"" section. Cover letters are optional.
Note: You do not need to complete your PLUM profile or video interview multiple times if you are applying to multiple positions. Also, we have full access to your entire profile from Plum and won’t use the screenshot but it’s a great reminder for each of you to have completed it.

How do I Apply?
For students, we believe evaluating you through relationships over resumes, and are focused on learning about who you are and what you’re interested in to uncover your true potential. In short, we don’t believe resumes will provide us with an accurate depiction of what you’re truly about in order to properly assess your potential. Instead we want to get to know YOU and hear about the experiences that have shaped you. We know… this might sound crazy but we do not want you to submit your resume instead we ask that as part of your application, you complete the below:
1) Complete your PLUM Profile here
2) Save your PLUM Profile as PDF. Click here to learn how
3) Complete a very short one-way video interview by clicking here (if you have already done this, you don't need to do it again)
4) When it prompts you to submit your resume, do not attach your resume! Instead, attach your most recent transcript and your PLUM profile in one PDF under the ""resume"" section. Cover letters are optional.
Note: You do not need to complete your PLUM profile or video interview multiple times if you are applying to multiple positions. Also, we have full access to your entire profile from Plum and won’t use the screenshot but it’s a great reminder for each of you to have completed it.

After enabling anyone to take a payment and never miss a sale, we saw sellers stymied by disparate, outmoded products and tools that wouldn’t work together. So we expanded into software and started building integrated, omnichannel solutions – to help sellers sell online, manage inventory, run a busy kitchen, book appointments, engage loyal buyers, and hire and pay staff. And across it all, we’ve embedded financial services tools at the point of sale, so merchants can access a business loan and manage their cash flow all in one place.  Today, we’re a partner to sellers of all sizes – large, enterprise-scale businesses with complex commerce operations, sellers just starting out, as well as merchants who began selling with Square and have grown larger over time. As our sellers scale, so do our solutions. We all grow together.   There is a massive opportunity in front of us. We’re building a business that is big, meaningful, and lasting. And we are helping sellers around the world do the same.

Since we first opened our doors in 2009, the world of commerce has evolved immensely – and so has Square. After enabling anyone to take a payment and never miss a sale, we saw sellers stymied by disparate, outmoded products and tools that wouldn’t work together. So we expanded into software and started building integrated, omnichannel solutions – to help sellers sell online, manage inventory, run a busy kitchen, book appointments, engage loyal buyers, and hire and pay staff. And across it all, we’ve embedded financial services tools at the point of sale, so merchants can access a business loan and manage their cash flow all in one place.

Today, we’re a partner to sellers of all sizes – large, enterprise-scale businesses with complex commerce operations, sellers just starting out, as well as merchants who began selling with Square and have grown larger over time. As our sellers scale, so do our solutions. We all grow together.


There is a massive opportunity in front of us. We’re building a business that is big, meaningful, and lasting. And we are helping sellers around the world do the same.

You will:

Manage the development, reporting, and visualization of metrics for the entire Risk organization
Develop and maintain various data pipelines and ETLs
Improve risk solutions through third-party evaluation and integration with a focus on improving the seller experience
Design and develop executive presentations for Square's leadership and board members
