Inaccurate projections and forecasts could cause the Centre to make costly decisions regarding levels of investigator and staff resources and other support.

Synthesize complex analyses into consumable stories with actionable insights.
Break down - and often reframe - business problems into well bounded problems solvable with data & analytics.
Exercise good judgment - appropriately discerning when basic techniques are sufficient and when advanced methods are required.

Senior Data Analyst at Elemy

Analytics teams at Elemy play a critical role in driving rapid, rational decision making in support of product, operations, marketing, engineering, and business teams. We are masters of business context who can apply a broad set of data science & analytics techniques to solve amorphous problems. As a Senior Data Analyst, you will partner with functional teams across Elemy to build metrics that are durable, design experiments that are defensible, create dashboards that are extensively utilized for decision making, and help shape an analytics practice that appropriately balances speed, accuracy, and risk. You will be a leader within the Elemy Data & Analytics organization, mentoring junior analysts and meaningfully contributing to how analytics at Elemy are done.

What You’ll Do

Solve problems that matter.
Deeply understand the world of pediatric behavioral therapy, the stakeholders involved, and how analytics can (and cannot!) be deployed to bring this industry into the digital age.
Partner with colleagues in analytics and the business to identify key metrics we should track, analysis we should embark upon, and dashboards we should build.
Understand, implement, and maintain key data pipelines that relate to your specific area of the business. Contribute to our data ecosystem management strategy.
Synthesize complex analyses into consumable stories with actionable insights.
Break down - and often reframe - business problems into well bounded problems solvable with data & analytics.
Exercise good judgment - appropriately discerning when basic techniques are sufficient and when advanced methods are required.

Who You Are

5+ years working in an analytics team at a high-growth company
Excellent SQL skills, ability to write and debug complex SQL queries
Excellent written communication skills
Experience with Snowflake, Github, dbt, Python, and R is a plus
Experience with at least one data visualization tool (e.g. Looker, Tableau, Periscope)
A track record of working autonomously, with strong organizational and time management skills
Experience with communicating data driven insights to business stakeholders
Experience coaching business colleagues on how to leverage analytics appropriately
Experience mentoring other analysts is a plus

At Elemy, we are a globally-distributed team with many of our team members located throughout the world, including in the following cities: San Francisco, New York, Los Angeles, Miami, Toronto, Montreal, and Kyiv. While everyone currently works remotely, we envision a future that balances face-to-face collaboration with a remote-friendly environment.

The above job description is meant to describe the general nature and level of work being performed; it is not intended to be construed as an exhaustive list of all responsibilities, duties, and skills required for the position.

Elemy is an equal opportunity employer that is committed to providing all employees with a work environment free of discrimination and harassment. We celebrate diversity and welcome applicants from every background and life experience.

Since we first opened our doors in 2009, the world of commerce has evolved immensely – and so has Square. After enabling anyone to take a payment and never miss a sale, we saw sellers stymied by disparate, outmoded products and tools that wouldn’t work together. So we expanded into software and started building integrated, omnichannel solutions – to help sellers sell online, manage inventory, run a busy kitchen, book appointments, engage loyal buyers, and hire and pay staff. And across it all, we’ve embedded financial services tools at the point of sale, so merchants can access a business loan and manage their cash flow all in one place.

Today, we’re a partner to sellers of all sizes – large, enterprise-scale businesses with complex commerce operations, sellers just starting out, as well as merchants who began selling with Square and have grown larger over time. As our sellers scale, so do our solutions. We all grow together.


There is a massive opportunity in front of us. We’re building a business that is big, meaningful, and lasting. And we are helping sellers around the world do the same.

About the Company:
 FLEETCOR Technologies, Inc. (“FLEETCOR”) is a leading global provider of business payment solutions. We help companies of all sizes control, simplify and secure payment of various domestic and cross-border payables using specialized payment products. We serve businesses, partners, merchants, consumers and payment networks in North America, Latin America, Europe, and Asia Pacific.

 Our payment solutions provide our customers with a payment method designed to be superior to and more robust and effective than what they use currently, whether they use a competitor’s product or another alternative method such as cash or check. We group our payment solutions into five primary categories: Fuel, Lodging, Tolls, Corporate Payments and Gift. Each category is unique in its focus, customer base and target markets, but they also share a number of characteristics: customers are primarily businesses, have recurring revenue models, have specialized networks which create barriers to entry, have high margins, and have similar selling systems. 
 

FLEETCOR enjoys global recognition including:


Forbes Global Growth Champion – FLEETCOR is one of the 250 fastest growing companies in the world as determined by Forbes and Statista
Forbes World’s Most Innovative Companies – FLEETCOR has made this prestigious list of leading innovative companies 4 years in a row!
Fortune 1000 Company – FLEETCOR was one of the largest movers in the new rankings of the largest companies in America, ranking #872
S&P 500 – In 2018, FLEETCOR joined the S&P stock index comprised of the 500 leading US stocks based on market cap (company value)
 Our Vision 
 
 Despite many advances in our industry, the majority of business payments are still made with outdated and inferior payment methods, such as checks and cash. We envision a business world where every purchase is controlled, every payment is digital, and every payment-related decision is well-informed. In this future paperless state, payments will require little to no time to manage, leaving companies with more time for what matters most: activities that grow their businesses. 
 
 Our Mission 
 
 FLEETCOR’s mission is to provide businesses with a better way to pay, by replacing outdated payment methods such as checks and cash, and displacing the incumbent providers of those methods. Through the digitalization of payments, we create and support robust ecosystems which benefit all participating constituents: payment-making customers, payment-accepting merchants, tax-collecting governments, and FLEETCOR. 
 
 Our Strategy 
 
 FLEETCOR is a growth company, and we employ a simple three-prong strategy for growing our business: 
 

More Customers. We invest more than $200 million per year in sales and marketing, predominately focused on new customer acquisition. We continue to scale existing sales channels and headcount, enable our sales people with demand generation and other tools, and launch new distribution channels both internally and through partners such as ERP software providers, telematics companies, and banks. We will also grow our customer base inorganically through acquisitions.
More Spend. We seek to leverage our existing customer relationships and capture greater share of their business payment expenditures. As such, we have developed various “beyond” initiatives, where we extend the utility of an existing payment product without degrading the core value proposition of the original product. As such, a customer can “buy more stuff” without sacrificing the controls and reporting which attracted the customer to our product to begin with. For example:
Our Fuel card customers can enable their cards to allow non-fuel purchases relevant to their business, like allowing a painting crew to buy supplies at a home improvement store, so they can finish the paint job.
Our Toll tag customers can use their in-vehicle RFID tags to make other “on the go” purchases like parking, fuel and fast-food.
 For our customers, these product extensions reduce payment friction, saving them time and operational headaches. For FLEETCOR, these product extensions can increase our share of wallet with existing customers and can increase our products’ appeal and applicability to previously-unserved customer segments (e.g., non-toll urban dwellers). We also create new product offerings, developed internally or in conjunction with partners, to cross-sell to our existing customer base. 
 

More Geographies. We continue to seek attractive entry opportunities in major international markets, which we intend to pursue through acquisitions and partnerships.
 Our Commitment to Diversity, Equality, Inclusion, Belonging 
 
 Together we can foster true belonging. We know different ideas, perspectives and backgrounds lead to better innovation and results. We are therefore committed to building and nurturing a culture of diversity, inclusion, and belonging by: 
 

Welcoming people of different backgrounds, cultures, ethnicities, genders, and sexual orientations;
Empowering our people to share their experiences and ideas through open forums and individual conversations; and
Valuing each person’s unique perspectives and individual contributions.
 Embracing diversity enables our people to “make the difference” at FLEETCOR. 
 
 Our Values 
 
 FLEETCOR’s culture reflects our history of fast growth and our continued drive for results. Our entrepreneurial spirit remains strong across our global workforce, and we reinforce these principles in our five core values: 
 

Innovation: Figure out a better way
Execution: Get it done quickly
Integrity: Do the right thing
People: We make the difference
Collaboration: Accomplish more together
 These values guide all of our employees and are infused in all aspects of our Company. We are, as a team, united through these shared values and our mission to provide “a better way to pay.” 
 
 Our values foster an inclusive culture through the expectation that all employees will treat each other with respect and appreciate the diversity of identities, thoughts, backgrounds and styles. Our commitment to fostering an inclusive culture has never been more essential than in this moment of national reflection. We must always celebrate the diversity of our company and our communities. 
 
 We strongly believe that the quality and diversity of our workforce provide FLEETCOR with a competitive advantage, and that our problem-solving and solution-building efforts are greatly enhanced when we harness the collective thinking of a diverse group of people with unique experiences and perspectives. 
 

FLEETCOR’s COVID-19 Hiring Guidelines:
 Due to COVID-19, most of our employees are temporarily working from home. In addition, FLEETCOR implemented a virtual interviewing and hiring process, engaging with talent by phone or video and onboarding new employees remotely. We value the safety of each member of our community because we know we’re all in this together.

About the team

The marketing analytics team collaborates with marketing channel leads, internal data teams (BI, Data Engineering, and Data Science), and various internal stakeholders that are responsible for driving 750MM+ annually in revenue from consumer and service professional acquisition.

The analytics team is made up of data analysts that are strategic business partners. They work across Angi's portfolio of brands and all major marketing platforms, both Digital Marketing (SEM, Paid App, Display, Social, Affiliate, TV) and Brand Marketing (TV and Offline Media).

The goals of the marketing analytics team will be to:

Arm marketing teams with the tools, data, and reporting needed to make investment decisions.
Uncover actionable insights (through data analysis, modeling, statistical testing) that will maximize revenue, lower cost, and improve customer/pro retention.

About the role

Angi is looking for a Senior Business Analyst to join the Marketing Analytics team. This position will be a key part of a growing analytics team that supports an increasingly sophisticated marketing program. As a senior member of the team, you will partner closely with marketing leads to provide the analytical support that will help drive growth in consumer and service professional acquisition. You will be expected to write custom SQL and build models to help drive our marketing strategy, build reporting in Looker, provide recommendations for A/B testing, and interpret test results. Additionally, you will dive into any issues and provide recommendations as needed. You will be the subject matter expert for the marketing teams you support!

Some of the analytics and reporting challenges the team faces include:

How should we allocate budget across all channels (and within channels) to maximize return on ad spend (ROAS) and improve consumer lifetime value?
Can we systematically identify anomalies in performance to ensure we maximize ROI?
Can we use our internal supply and demand data to ensure we do not waste marketing dollars?
How can we leverage our TV marketing data to get an accurate ROI and drive growth?
What impact does TV and Offline Media have on other marketing channels?
How does marketing impact Angi brand health metrics like awareness, consideration and loyalty? What tactics can we use to improve these metrics?
What attribution methodologies should we explore to properly value investments?

What you'll do

Learn the complex Angi ecosystem and overall Angi marketing strategy in order to be a subject matter expert on all data analysis and modeling related to marketing.
Empower teams to make data-informed decisions by creating Looker dashboards and reports, writing custom SQL queries that provide insightful observations, and creating predictive models.
Mold 3rd party data from platforms where we buy media with internal data through SQL to provide insights and recommendations.
Collaborate closely with other data teams (data engineering, science, etc.) to build database tables in Snowflake and ensure there are no gaps in our infrastructure.
Prepare and present quantitative analyses in a digestible manner for the larger marketing organization (i.e. be the translator between the technical and non-technical).
Develop test plans to measure the performance of acquisition strategies and inform optimizations and future tests.
Own and lead analyses using data and insights to influence and support marketing strategy.
Conduct ad hoc investigations into anomalies as well as different drivers of channel performance.
Drive the move from Tableau to Looker: Partner with business owners to build, automate, and ensure the accuracy of business-critical reporting (i.e. ensure that key marketing metrics are visible for stakeholders).
Work with teams across the business to help find the optimal balance between consumer demand and supply-side inventory.
Analyze user behavior and build models to improve repeat usage and LTV.

What we're looking for

Bachelor's (or Master's) degree in a technical field such as Business Analytics, Engineering, Finance, Economics, Computer Science, Stats, etc.
3+ years of professional experience in a business analysis or data analyst role
Advanced SQL knowledge, expertise in Excel, and Looker (or Tableau) experience
Strong grasp of statistics and statistical software (Python, and/or R experience is preferred to run tests and correlation/regression analysis)
Superior analytical, problem-structuring, and problem-solving skills; experience synthesizing data into information, and presenting concise analyses
Creative problem solver who can tackle large, nebulous questions (i.e. the ability to break questions into parts, to validate results of analyses by reconciling with data from other sources).
Strong communication skills, both oral and written
Experience in with Google Analytics and/or Adobe Analytics is a plus
Experience with a TV Analytics platform or Marketing Mix Modeling partner is a plus
Willingness to get hands dirty and do whatever it takes to ensure success

At Amazon, we work hard to make the products our customers want and love available for purchase on our website. Last year, we ordered more than 10 billion items from hundreds of thousands of vendors. More impressive than the numbers are the people behind the services. Procurement is a diverse, 2-pizza team which owns the software systems that create and process the purchase orders for all Amazon retail items.

In your role as a Business Intelligence Engineer II (BIE II) on the Procurement team, you will collaborate with product and technical teams to develop and track key metrics, automate reporting and data processing solutions, and manage data pipelines and infrastructure. Your data-driven insights will help us recognize business opportunities, influence our product roadmap, diagnose system issues and defects, and make the best possible decisions regarding how we collaborate with vendors and suppliers.
To accomplish these tasks, you will need to be able to analyze and extract relevant information from large, complicated data sets of structured and unstructured data. You must be proficient at producing and maintaining scaled, automated, user-friendly reporting systems and dashboards. You will need to be confident presenting metrics to senior business leaders, providing valuable insights and making call-outs, tracking progress on team goals, and owning the management and prioritization of data deep-dives.
