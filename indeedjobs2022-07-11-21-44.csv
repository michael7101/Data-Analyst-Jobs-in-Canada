   Job Summary
 

   Learning analytics refers to ""the measurement, collection, analysis and reporting of data about learners and their contexts for purposes of understanding and optimizing learning and the environments in which learning occurs"" (Society for Learning Analytics, http://www.solaresearch.org)
 

   In the Faculty of Arts, a number of learning analytics projects are underway to allow deans, heads, administrators, and faculty members to make use of existing data about students, learning and teaching to better understand 'what is happening' in our courses and programs. The goal, always, is to use available data to answer questions that can support decision-making.
 

   The individual in this role is responsible for providing support and maintenance of existing reports, and working with stakeholders for planning and implementing data projects to explore, analyze and interpret data sets relevant to teaching and learning (including but not limited to: enrollment and admission records and performance data; learner demographics; course and project evaluation data; survey data.)
 

   The incumbent will stay abreast of current developments in data analytics and institutional analysis and contribute to strategic planning in this area in the Faculty of Arts and the University.
 


   Organizational Status
 

   The Data Analyst is part of a team that provides the Faculty of Arts with instructional and information technology support services for the administrative, teaching, and research needs of approximately thirty departments, schools, and units, supporting over 1,000 faculty, 600 staff, and 16,000 students.
 

   The Data Analytics group undertakes ongoing analysis of and reporting of Arts teaching and learning data to deans, heads & directors. Findings from data analysis and presentation of results in regular reports contribute to: departmental decision-making regarding re-appointment and promotion/tenure of teaching staff; departmental decision-making regarding curriculum planning and course offerings; departmental external review processes; and a range of ongoing initiatives to further advance teaching, learning and quality assurance in the Faculty of Arts.
 

   Reports to the Director, Arts Instructional Support & Information Technology (Arts ISIT). The role liaises regularly with deans, heads, and administrators in the Faculty of Arts.

You will have strong experience with Looker and preferably experience in a fast-growing software company. You are excited about the opportunity to be responsible for analytics across multiple subject areas and looking forward to the prospect of mentoring junior analysts.
   




   Our small, collaborative team is responsible for delivering actionable insights across the entirety of Jane, so you are interested in championing a data informed culture across all areas of the business, from marketing to product and everything in between. You are passionate about transparency, accuracy, creating delightful experiences with data, and digging deep in to the ""why."" 
   We want every team at Jane to have the ability to make decisions inspired by data and you will have the opportunity to help make this happen from the ground up.
   




   Like with all positions at Jane, this position is a remote position, allowing you to work anywhere you want across Canada. Building a delighted team who can delight our customers is part of Jane’s DNA, so even though we’re not a strict 9 to 5 environment, we’re working hard to ensure that you also have a life outside of work. We pride ourselves on flexibility & autonomy, and when it comes to decision making, we take a decentralized approach ensuring that our teams' voices aren't just heard, but are acted upon. We're building something special at Jane, and we back that up with an employee stock option plan that ensures that everyone has a chance to share in Jane’s success.
  


 We really want the people who work at Jane to love being here, so it's important that we start off with a bit about what makes our company unique. Here are some specifics about what Jane is all about, and with these, hopefully, you have a better idea if this might be the kind of company you want to be part of.
  


 We’re a North Vancouver-born SaaS company with a distributed remote team across Canada, and our platform is modernizing the world of practice management software. We enable the likes of physiotherapists, mental health counsellors, chiropractors, and other allied health practitioners to run their practices in a digital-first way through features such as online booking, charting, scheduling, secure video, and billing along with an evolving library of features.
  


 Tens of thousands of healthcare practices globally are now running on Jane. In 2021, we processed over 73 million patient appointments, and our scheduling application alone handles more than 10 million API calls per day. Jane is now the number one choice for Allied Healthcare practitioners in Canada. We’re growing quicker in the US than we were here in Canada 3 years ago, and we’re now helping run clinics in 44 countries.
  


 We’re profitable, product-led, and growing organically to the point where 85% of our customer growth is either from customer referrals or word of mouth. Growth like this is unique, especially in the world of SaaS, and it doesn’t happen by chance. We have a brilliant team of over 250 employees who all do an amazing job of listening to our customers, building what they need, and providing industry-leading support.
  


 Last year alone we’ve grown our development team from 36 to 70, and the product team has doubled as a whole. 2022 is going to be a big year for Jane as we’re investing heavily into patient experience with our first patient-facing mobile app, enhancing our telehealth experience, building our own (J)analytics platform, working on global insurance integrations, and introducing new features like HIPAA compliant chat.
  


 Of course, it's not all about the numbers, but this puts into perspective the scale of Jane, from the thousands of practitioners whose lives are made easier each day to the millions of patients receiving treatment. If you’re the type of person excited by this growth, we’d love to speak with you.
  



What you’ll be doing…


 Own several areas of analysis including product and customer lifecycle while working directly with product managers, dev managers and senior leadership to encourage a data-informed culture
 Helping our team build out our new Looker instance, including supporting with documentation, onboarding, training and best practices
 Creating and improving existing metrics, models, dimensions and documentation through collaboration with the team and stakeholders across multiple subject areas
 Championing data-informed decision making, building trust with stakeholders across Jane, and developing policies to uphold our standards
 Testing hypotheses that drive product roadmap decisions by designing purpose-built experiments and performing statistical analysis
 Own analysis from concept to implementation, managing backlog and prioritization of incoming and existing work
 Proactively seek feedback and opportunities to improve our processes, engage stakeholders






To be successful in this role...


 Experience as a data analyst in a high-growth environment
 Familiarity with common SaaS metrics and experience defining, implementing and measuring them
 Experience with Looker development and as a Looker admin
 Desire to mentor other analysts and continue to flex and grow that muscle
 Excellent communication skills and empathy

   Job Description Summary
 

   The UBC Department of Family Practice (DFP) has established the primary care Innovation Support Unit (ISU) to connect, engage, and partner with those who are actively involved in innovations in primary care. The ISU is initially focused on supporting innovations in community-situated, team-based care (TBC) in BC, which includes initiatives in primary care transformation such as the Patient s Medical Home (PMH) and Primary Care Networks (PCNs) as these are key provincial strategic elements in achieving a sustainable and high-quality community and primary care system in BC. We are working with collaborators at UBC, the Ministry of Health, BC primary care communities and several other groups.
 

 The ISU has several interconnected 
  workstreams related to specific aspects of TBC transformation in Primary Care. Workstreams are a collection of applied, multi-method projects clustering around a particular pressing issue or need in primary care in BC. Workstreams focus on different areas such as: supporting transformation in the primary care system (e.g., designing, testing and deployment of new methods to support change), development of a team-based care evaluation framework and evaluation methods for team-based care; or support for the team based care advisory.
 


   The ISU has been established as a small but nimble and highly networked team, working with many stakeholders. We are currently, looking to hire 1-2 more Research Analysts to support the workstreams.
  
 Analysts will work with workstream leads and ISU faculty, to perform a range of activities including: reviews of literature, support for the Primary Care Transformation workstream in the implementation of primary care transformation tools (e.g. Team and PACC mapping).

   Some of our work will require more familiarity with action research and literature reviews, as well as quantitative and qualitative analysis. Other parts of our work focus more on design thinking, engagement of stakeholders and facilitation.
 


   As the ISU has a Teal organizational structure, the Research Analysts will be responsible for engaging across workstreams as required and as fits the skills of each of the team members. In this way, the ISU works very collaboratively and seeks to match team members to projects / workstreams that build on their strengths and skills. The ISU has opportunities for people with a range of skills and experience to broaden the team’s views as we tackle the complex challenges in primary care. We are looking for diversity and a broad range of experiences to complement other members of the team.
 


   In the ISU we value justice, equity, diversity and inclusion (JEDI) and are working to develop and apply this lens as we work to support primary care systems change. As a team we engage with learning related to the decolonization of research and healthcare systems; team members are expected to have a willingness to learn, unlearn and engage in this work.
  
 Organizational Status

The ISU is a core unit of the department whose goal is to bring an applied academic lens to the changes that are actively occurring in primary care across the province. The ISU’s initial focus has been on team-based care.
