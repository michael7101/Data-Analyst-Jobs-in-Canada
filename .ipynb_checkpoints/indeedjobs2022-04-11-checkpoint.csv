 The Capital One way.

 Yes, we’re a credit card company. But we’re more than that too. We’re driven by what our customers want, and how to make their lives simpler.

 We’re always looking for creative ways to offer digital solutions that make sense for our customers. With your help, we’ll build the next generation of banking in Canada based on customer-focused values, compelling products and great engineering.

 A day in the life of a Capital One Business Analyst.

 Embedded within a cross-functional team, you’ll bring your strategies to life from conception and analytical business case building to in-market delivery, measuring their impact through testing and monitoring, and ultimately being accountable for both customer and financial outcomes. You’ll spend time gathering and visualizing data, storytelling through presentations, collaborating with experts in areas like legal and technology, and influencing senior leadership on critical decisions. 

You’ll work with tools like SQL to query data, use spreadsheets and python-based notebooks to organize it, and slides to present it, along with a number of other modern analytics tools. Working in an agile, cross-functional team you’ll also have the opportunity to learn from other job families like data scientists, process managers, and product owners.

 Here are a few of the ways our Business Analysts are helping people take control of their credit:



 Underwriting (Credit Policy & Valuations): Business Analysts are responsible for assisting in developing & maintaining statistical models and the associated credit policies that help us determine who we extended credit to. Analysts in the space perform analysis on credit performance to help influence how we update and optimize our models & policies.
 Fraud: Business Analysts are responsible for developing the defences and policies to mitigate fraud losses for Capital One, creating a safe and secure experience for our customers. Analysts in the space perform diligent monitoring to understand emerging fraud trends and propose actions to prevent fraudulent behaviour.
 Product Development: Business Analysts are responsible for developing the strategies to test and scale new financial product offerings. Analysts conduct market & customer research, and couple these insights with internal data modelling to propose new solutions for our customers. Analysts in this space work with process and technology experts to get new products in the hands of our customers, and iterate upon our offerings based on consumer reception.




 Be ready to join a community of the smartest people you’ve ever met, who see the customer first, and want to use their data skills to change banking for good.
