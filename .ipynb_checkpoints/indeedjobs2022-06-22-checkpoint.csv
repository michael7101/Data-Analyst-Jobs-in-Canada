Influence. You want to work across multiple products, collaborating across the organization, and helping build out our move to the cloud. You want the chance to work in a truly Agile environment where your voice will be heard. You will be given the hands-on opportunity to make a difference as you develop an understanding of how the technologies and solutions work with each other, what the limitations are and how to implement and release cloud features. 

Exposure. You want to be part of a company that is forward-thinking and setting the standards in an industry. As Altus builds out our cloud offering and the products that take our thousands of global users along different paths in the PropTech sector, you will gain exposure to tools, technologies, and people as you work on projects that fulfill our vision.

Collaborate. You enjoy working with other BAs and across departments as part of a cross-functional team.

The right combination of education and experience. You have experience working as a BA - you know how to break needs down into user stories and how to translate and give directions to ensure we build to specifications. 
A genuine interest in new tools and technology. You learn new software quickly without documentation or hand-holding. You want to grow your exposure to cloud technology. 
A winning communication style. You have a way of speaking that engages your audience and instills confidence and credibility. You know how to leverage communication tools and methodologies. 
A high standard of thoroughness. Your attention to detail guides you. 
A true sense of obligation and responsibility. You love what you do. This isn’t a job. This is a career. You are invested in satisfying the needs of our clients – your clients- and you work hard to do it well, on spec, and on time. 
A solution-focused drive. You investigate issues thoroughly and create effective solutions that solve problems and open up new opportunities.

  Since we first opened our doors in 2009, the world of commerce has evolved immensely – and so has Square. After enabling anyone to take a payment and never miss a sale, we saw sellers stymied by disparate, outmoded products and tools that wouldn’t work together. So we expanded into software and started building integrated, omnichannel solutions – to help sellers sell online, manage inventory, run a busy kitchen, book appointments, engage loyal buyers, and hire and pay staff. And across it all, we’ve embedded financial services tools at the point of sale, so merchants can access a business loan and manage their cash flow all in one place.  Today, we’re a partner to sellers of all sizes – large, enterprise-scale businesses with complex commerce operations, sellers just starting out, as well as merchants who began selling with Square and have grown larger over time. As our sellers scale, so do our solutions. We all grow together.  There is a massive opportunity in front of us. We’re building a business that is big, meaningful, and lasting. And we are helping sellers around the world do the same.

 As a Lead Business Intelligence Analyst on the team, you will help define and drive risk strategy through data analysis and insights. You will manage top level risk metrics, maintain and develop the data pipeline and ETL, establish core operational metrics, and drive process improvements through analysis. You will also build and coordinate executive presentation materials for Square's leadership team.
 You will:

 Diagnose problems and develop compelling, data-driven recommendations
 Partner with Product, Engineering, and Data Science teams to design solutions to operations problems, influence product roadmaps, and solution new products/processes
 Manage the development, reporting, and visualization of metrics for the entire Risk organization
 Develop and maintain various data pipelines and ETLs
 Improve risk solutions through third-party evaluation and integration with a focus on improving the seller experience
 Design and develop executive presentations for Square's leadership and board members




 Qualifications
